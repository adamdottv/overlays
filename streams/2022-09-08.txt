00:12:23
<transcript>: i had

00:12:32
<transcript>: I updated to the latest macOS.

00:12:32
<transcript>: so let's find

00:12:34
geeklabel: Hey

00:12:38
<transcript>: So let's find out if that's a problem. I don't know what would be the problem here.

00:12:43
niftynate80: I chose violence

00:12:45
<transcript>: Geek Label first time chat. Welcome.

00:12:45
<transcript>: to chat

00:12:46
<transcript>: To chat.

00:12:46
<transcript>: you chose

00:12:48
<transcript>: You chose.

00:12:48
fragaverage: The plot twist... is that the AWS advocate builds AWGuess without using any AWS services...

00:12:52
<transcript>: I got to figure out.

00:12:57
athano: @FragAverage LUL

00:13:01
<transcript>: Oh, no, I don't think I am gonna use any of your services, am I? We're building up the T three stack.

00:13:05
geeklabel: Thanks 😂

00:13:06
<transcript>: How about that.

00:13:06
<transcript>: i mean

00:13:11
<transcript>: I mean somewhere down under there we're using it a viscer. So it's like planet scale. They use AWS.

00:13:11
<transcript>: i gotta

00:13:15
<transcript>: I gotta figure out how to put my stuff on. Apparently.

00:13:15
<transcript>: it cannot

00:13:19
<transcript>: It cannot control. Let's see, let me try again.

00:13:21
caldotjs: btw what is a AWS DevTools Hero?

00:13:28
<transcript>: Let's try again and just make sure it doesn't just work now what? I definitely turn something on. I forgot to turn something on.

00:13:30
<transcript>: No, I don't think so.

00:13:31
<transcript>: Hang on.

00:13:33
caldotjs: ahh nice. the t3 stack is really cool to use

00:13:38
<transcript>: I gave it permissions to do the keyboard thing.

00:13:38
<transcript>: i thought

00:13:39
<transcript>: I thought.

00:13:42
<transcript>: What would it be? It would be.

00:13:42
<transcript>: alacrity

00:13:44
<transcript>: Alacrity. Needs permission.

00:13:53
<transcript>: This is what I get for updating Mac OS. I should have known everything had gone so smoothly, like I've had no issues.

00:13:53
<transcript>: i guess

00:13:55
<transcript>: I guess I hadn't tried streaming.

00:13:55
<transcript>: so

00:13:58
<transcript>: So thanks for the following Geek label. I appreciate that.

00:14:09
<transcript>: An AWS Dev Tools Hero 80s Heroes. It's a program. Aws has they're like community members that do community things.

00:14:09
<transcript>: i don't know

00:14:11
<transcript>: I don't know if you're familiar with that.

00:14:21
stream_kyle: @caldotjs https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes

00:14:22
<transcript>: Like a Microsoft MVP. It's kind of like that. That's what I remember from, like a decade ago. I think there's Google Cloud Experts. It's like.

00:14:22
<transcript>: i don't know

00:14:27
<transcript>: I don't know. Some kind of recognition for there you go, Kyle's posted it.

00:14:37
<transcript>: It's like a worldwide thing. So there's there's a few hundred here's worldwide, and there's different categories. So I'm in the Dev Tools category.

00:14:42
<transcript>: Which is like open source and Dev tooling.

00:14:42
<transcript>: develop

00:14:42
stream_kyle: @caldotjs https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/adam-elmore

00:14:44
<transcript>: Developer experience, all that kind of stuff.

00:14:57
<transcript>: I'm trying to find permission. This is a new this is a new thing. I am not used to this in the latest macOS. There's a new. Okay.

00:14:57
<transcript>: where the

00:15:00
<transcript>: Where the menu system is different.

00:15:03
<transcript>: I need to give keyboard.

00:15:03
<transcript>: will that

00:15:05
<transcript>: Will that be automation.

00:15:10
<transcript>: Automation Permit for permission.

00:15:10
<transcript>: maybe

00:15:11
<transcript>: Maybe.

00:15:14
<transcript>: Or.

00:15:14
<transcript>: how do we

00:15:16
<transcript>: How do we get this working before.

00:15:21
caldotjs: Nice, thank you!

00:15:21
<transcript>: Input monitoring seems wrong.

00:15:26
<transcript>: Well.

00:15:31
<transcript>: That's a bummer. If the filters don't work today, I can manually turn them on.

00:15:39
<transcript>: Let's see what was redeemed. Open. Snap camera. Here we go.

00:15:41
<transcript>: Favorites.

00:15:41
<transcript>: patty

00:15:42
<transcript>: Patty. Partner. Here we go.

00:15:44
<transcript>: There you are.

00:15:44
<transcript>: you're welcome

00:15:46
<transcript>: You're welcome.

00:15:46
<transcript>: we lost some

00:15:48
<transcript>: We lost some automation today.

00:15:53
<transcript>: But we gained a friend geek label is here so I feel like that was worth the trade.

00:15:53
<transcript>: i mean

00:16:02
<transcript>: I mean, I guess geek label would have been here even if the automation still works, still worked. I don't know. I need an excuse to not be upset about the fact that I broke my overlays.

00:16:07
<transcript>: So we're gonna build AW guests today.

00:16:09
<transcript>: With the T Three stack.

00:16:19
<transcript>: We really didn't even get started. Like we Tuesday, I think no Monday stream. We kind of like.

00:16:19
<transcript>: had

00:16:20
<transcript>: Had the.

00:16:20
<transcript>: gen

00:16:31
<transcript>: Genesis for this thing. Cuba is named it. Aw, guess we bought all the domains. We kind of, like poked around in the T three stack. Just the first, like looking at the project structure, that kind of stuff.

00:16:42
<transcript>: And but we never really started building it. So I think this whole stream today is just gonna be start to finish build the thing the goal have it published on aws.com.

00:16:49
<transcript>: Or we can play against each other because I do want to make a multiplayer. We might start building it single player and then move to multiplayer, but.

00:16:57
<transcript>: That's the goal. We got a lot to do. We should probably get started. Anybody else? I don't know. I don't want to rush for.

00:16:59
<transcript>: Head over to my screen.

00:17:04
<transcript>: It's really gonna bother me if my overlays don't work anymore.

00:17:04
<transcript>: it's like it

00:17:06
<transcript>: It's like it can't control the keyboard.

00:17:07
fragaverage: does planetscale have realtime replication?

00:17:11
caldotjs: I wasn't there the last few stream. what is it about

00:17:13
<transcript>: But it just ask me if I could. If it could have permission. I gave it to it. I said, yes, you can have permission.

00:17:21
<transcript>: What is. Oh, yeah, yeah. I should explain what? Aw, guess is. Sorry.

00:17:23
<transcript>: Aw guess is.

00:17:23
<transcript>: a guessing

00:17:26
jenswoeste: do you know cloudcraft?

00:17:30
<transcript>: A guessing game where you're given an AWS Service logo. You know, there's like 300 AWS services.

00:17:30
<transcript>: and

00:17:36
<transcript>: And every service has like, a logo, an icon. They're in my.

00:17:36
<transcript>: office

00:17:40
<transcript>: Office hanging on the wall. I do a painting shot of it during my intro.

00:18:00
<transcript>: so it's gonna show you an icon of one of the three hundred services and you have to guess which service it is you have like four choices multiple choice right and it's gonna be like a speed thing how many can you do i mean can you guess correctly in some amount of time but we're also gonna get multiplayer where you can like challenge somebody or just randomly plague in somebody we'll figure it

00:18:00
<transcript>: we haven't really

00:18:15
<transcript>: We haven't really gotten too deep into the what features it'll have, but I want to have a leaderboard, all that kind of stuff, just we're trying to really just explore the T three sack, and I needed a full stack thing to build. And this is something I wanted to build a long time ago.

00:18:17
<transcript>: So.

00:18:22
<transcript>: Here we go. And Qits came up with an amazing name for it. Aw, guess.

00:18:22
<transcript>: do you see

00:18:26
<transcript>: Do you see it? Sounds like AWS, but it's AW, guess.

00:18:28
caldotjs: sounds fun! I think your white-balance just went loopy for a second adamel4Adambar

00:18:28
<transcript>: Pretty cool.

00:18:28
<transcript>: that's a good one

00:18:29
<transcript>: That's a good one.

00:18:29
<transcript>: okay

00:18:31
<transcript>: Okay.

00:18:37
<transcript>: Oh yeah. We're not doing tmach right now. Cow face was so kind to.

00:18:37
<transcript>: help

00:18:39
<transcript>: Help us out.

00:18:39
<transcript>: learning

00:18:41
<transcript>: Learning pmux.

00:18:41
<transcript>: yes

00:18:43
<transcript>: Yesterday, the day before Tuesday.

00:18:49
<transcript>: My wife balance that loopy. I keep hearing things like that.

00:18:49
<transcript>: i

00:18:51
<transcript>: I wonder if it's because I'm pushing.

00:18:55
<transcript>: The bitrate if Twitch has issues.

00:19:04
<transcript>: Past six K bitrate. I wonder if that's the issue because I have heard people say it goes blank and comes back or it's the white balance is weird.

00:19:10
<transcript>: So let's know if everybody's seeing that, then I can fix something on the stream. So it's our topic building.

00:19:10
<transcript>: aw

00:19:12
<transcript>: Aw guess with T.

00:19:12
<transcript>: t

00:19:20
<transcript>: T three Stack We should actually update the title of this. I don't even know what the title is. Join Twitch today. What.

00:19:24
fragaverage: welp[

00:19:26
caldotjs: again. I assume its the w/b. it just got darker and then it flips back

00:19:28
<transcript>: Deal with it, okay? I have to manually turn it on. So we broke everything.

00:19:30
<transcript>: Snap camera.

00:19:33
<transcript>: This is bad.

00:19:37
<transcript>: Deal with it.

00:19:44
<transcript>: Is which one? It's the chains. This one deal with it. Okay.

00:19:48
<transcript>: What a bummer.

00:19:48
<transcript>: what's

00:19:51
<transcript>: What's a bummer that I broke things.

00:19:54
<transcript>: I broke something.

00:19:57
fragaverage: could just be the camera switch between snapcam and the camlink

00:19:57
<transcript>: Hoping I could just see.

00:20:00
<transcript>: Whatever.

00:20:00
<transcript>: i

00:20:02
<transcript>: I could try restarting my overlays. Let's try. That.

00:20:05
<transcript>: Let's try restarting the overlay.

00:20:05
<transcript>: this one

00:20:19
laytanl_: Hello!

00:20:21
<transcript>: We'll see if it works next time.

00:20:31
<transcript>: It's just the white balance. It got darker, and then it flips back.

00:20:31
<transcript>: could just

00:20:35
caldotjs: but its even switching while the same overlay or even no overlay is enabled

00:20:41
<transcript>: Could just be the camera switching snack game. Oh, that's true, too. Oh, yeah, yeah, that's what it is latency. Hey, Leighton. So whenever remember when we were building the overlays long ago.

00:20:41
<transcript>: okay

00:20:43
<transcript>: Okay like last week.

00:20:49
<transcript>: When I used the SnapCam, my camera has the 720p because SnapCam on camera.

00:20:49
<transcript>: os

00:20:57
<transcript>: Os sucks and you can't choose resolution so it's 720p but I don't like if there's not a filter on my face. I don't like.

00:20:57
<transcript>: not being

00:21:11
<transcript>: Not being in 1080p. So I have a scene that's my 1080p camera, and then I have a scene that's the snap camera and I toggle back and forth based on whether there is a filter to put on my face. So somebody just redeemed the thing.

00:21:18
<transcript>: Deal with it. I've got this going on with the cigarette and all that. Then it switches over to the 720p scene.

00:21:18
<transcript>: if

00:21:23
<transcript>: If once it expires after five minutes, it'll switch back, that's what the Y bouncing is. I think.

00:21:24
zappy_idk: I heard latency here instead of laytan is here xD

00:21:29
<transcript>: I heard latency here instead of lateness here.

00:21:29
<transcript>: i mean laten

00:21:33
<transcript>: I mean latency might also be here. You guys getting any latency.

00:21:38
<transcript>: All right. Sorry. That I'm gonna I'm gonna just put this.

00:21:38
<transcript>: over

00:21:43
<transcript>: Over. I'm gonna swap out deal with it and see if this works.

00:21:43
<transcript>: no

00:21:45
<transcript>: No keyboard.

00:21:45
<transcript>: not like this

00:21:46
<transcript>: Not like this.

00:21:49
<transcript>: Let's turn on.

00:21:52
<transcript>: Key cache.

00:21:54
<transcript>: Keycaster running.

00:21:57
<transcript>: I don't think so. Key caster.

00:22:00
<transcript>: We're gonna get to it very shortly.

00:22:00
<transcript>: so

00:22:02
<transcript>: So is it working, that.

00:22:02
<transcript>: i type

00:22:04
<transcript>: I type? Where can I type.

00:22:07
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:22:07
<transcript>: there it is

00:22:11
<transcript>: There it is. Key caster. Okay, cool. I'm gonna switch over to my screen now.

00:22:11
<transcript>: a little bummed

00:22:14
danielgerep: Good morning. You look cool =)

00:22:14
<transcript>: A little bummed. We're not gonna have my.

00:22:18
<transcript>: Channel Point Redemption's working correctly.

00:22:18
<transcript>: oh

00:22:22
<transcript>: Oh, yeah? I want to see if when I do it I look cool. Thanks, Daniel.

00:22:22
<transcript>: that's what i'm going for

00:22:24
<transcript>: That's what I'm going for.

00:22:24
<transcript>: let's

00:22:25
<transcript>: Let's see if.

00:22:29
<transcript>: I redeem something.

00:22:34
<transcript>: It's showing the keys. No, it's not typing the keys.

00:22:40
<transcript>: It was always a flaky way that we're doing this right. The way we control the Snap camera is like.

00:22:40
<transcript>: i

00:22:43
<transcript>: I have a node app.

00:22:43
<transcript>: well it's

00:22:44
<transcript>: Well, it's just.

00:22:44
<transcript>: an api route

00:22:47
<transcript>: An API route but.

00:22:47
<transcript>: called

00:22:49
<transcript>: Called system level keyboard.

00:22:49
<transcript>: event

00:22:55
<transcript>: Events. It creates systems level keyboard events. And that's how we interact with SnapCam anyways.

00:22:57
<transcript>: Okay.

00:22:57
<transcript>: okay

00:22:58
<transcript>: Okay.

00:23:00
<transcript>: Let's.

00:23:00
<transcript>: do

00:23:04
<transcript>: Do things let's build we don't have time to mess with the today.

00:23:07
<transcript>: We're gonna build.

00:23:13
<transcript>: Aw, guess so. Let's go. Versaille.

00:23:13
<transcript>: and

00:23:16
<transcript>: And we're gonna add, I'm gonna go and move the domain over.

00:23:41
<transcript>: The domain is AW guest.com.

00:23:45
<transcript>: Got it.

00:23:48
<transcript>: Name Servers. We could do.

00:23:53
<transcript>: They don't recommend that, though.

00:23:57
<transcript>: Just want to set an A record.

00:24:00
<transcript>: I guess we could do that.

00:24:03
<transcript>: Okay.

00:24:03
<transcript>: namecheap

00:24:06
<transcript>: Namecheap gonna have to go Fuzzy for a SEC.

<transcript>: no

00:24:58
<transcript>: No.

00:25:06
<transcript>: Why is everything broken? It's like my stream deck is broken.

00:25:11
zappy_idk: dev life

00:25:13
<transcript>: Oh, man, this is what I get.

00:25:19
<transcript>: This is what I get. I thought I could just swap over to the new Mac OS.

00:25:19
<transcript>: and nobody would

00:25:21
<transcript>: And nobody would know the difference.

00:25:21
<transcript>: but i

00:25:24
<transcript>: But I broke literally everything.

00:25:27
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. Dax is coming on today.

00:25:27
<transcript>: da

00:25:34
<transcript>: Dax is gonna come on, you know, when he's awake like normal Americans around. I don't know. In a few hours.

00:25:37
<transcript>: He's just gonna hang out with us while we build AW, guess.

00:25:37
<transcript>: okay i got

00:25:39
<transcript>: Okay. I gotta turn this thing out.

00:25:41
<transcript>: That's not great.

00:25:41
<transcript>: why

00:25:44
jaystation3x: You did say YOLO

00:25:45
<transcript>: Why did enough switch cameras? What is this? Camera? Snap camera.

00:25:47
<transcript>: Okay.

00:25:47
<transcript>: and this sn

00:25:49
madlep: I tune in and every thing is broken and Adam is ranting about video resolution. This is the content I'm here for :D

00:25:50
<transcript>: And this snap camera pointed at.

00:25:54
<transcript>: Mimo.

00:25:57
<transcript>: Okay so semima didn't work.

00:26:01
<transcript>: Let's go back over here.

00:26:06
<transcript>: Yeah yeah definitely me most fault.

00:26:06
<transcript>: there's

00:26:09
fragaverage: the slightly transparent code is a good look tbh

00:26:09
<transcript>: There's just too much going on here. I've got too complicated to set up.

00:26:12
<transcript>: Did I turn on the other camera.

00:26:15
<transcript>: What.

00:26:18
<transcript>: Oh no.

00:26:26
<transcript>: This could be. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Let's just try changing here. So this is camera two.

00:26:30
<transcript>: Let's try this. There's my keyboard.

00:26:31
nikolarhristov: splitception

00:26:33
<transcript>: There it is.

00:26:33
<transcript>: all right

00:26:35
<transcript>: All right.

00:26:35
<transcript>: whoo

00:26:37
<transcript>: Whoo this is a lot.

00:26:41
<transcript>: This is a lot of broken. Okay one more time.

00:26:46
<transcript>: Hey, there I am. Okay.

00:26:46
<transcript>: it feels like

00:26:51
<transcript>: It feels like a Monday when you got this in the kinks you're working through feels a lot like a Monday.

00:26:51
<transcript>: well

00:26:58
<transcript>: Well, I'm in here, and we're gonna I promise we're gonna start building stuff with the T three stack very soon. But while I'm in here.

00:27:02
<transcript>: It occurs to me I learned some things about Chrome key.

00:27:02
<transcript>: that i can

00:27:06
<transcript>: That I can fix, and I'm gonna fix them right now.

00:27:06
<transcript>: filters

00:27:11
<transcript>: Filters Chrome key colors fine, but I can do smoothness.

00:27:11
<transcript>: way lower

00:27:14
<transcript>: Way lower. Okay.

00:27:14
<transcript>: like

00:27:15
<transcript>: Like.

00:27:19
<transcript>: Like that. And then I can do this way, higher.

00:27:21
<transcript>: I think.

00:27:24
norom: okay so

00:27:26
<transcript>: The net effect is better.

00:27:26
<transcript>: well

00:27:27
<transcript>: Well, I said that.

00:27:28
jaystation3x: Don't kink shame the setup.

00:27:36
norom: twitch decided to give you the best thumbnail just now: https://imgur.com/a/GnGVsJF

00:27:37
<transcript>: Maybe not.

00:27:44
<transcript>: But maybe.

00:27:46
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:27:46
<transcript>: similarity

00:27:55
<transcript>: Similarity if I go up like this feel like it's it's washing me out. So like clearly I've gone too far.

00:27:58
<transcript>: How was it? I did something.

00:28:02
<transcript>: Yeah? Turn that down? Yeah.

00:28:09
<transcript>: That doesn't need to be up. What was that? Okay, now I can go even higher. You can go to like, 90.

00:28:14
stroopwafel26: hello

00:28:16
<transcript>: I think this will be a better I don't have to have that stupid light on. I think this is a better Chroma key setting.

00:28:18
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:28:20
<transcript>: Feels good.

00:28:23
<transcript>: Does it? Does it feel good.

00:28:23
<transcript>: alright

00:28:24
<transcript>: Alright.

00:28:28
<transcript>: Sorry for the housekeeping. Apparently. I have to join Twitch.

00:28:34
madlep: kids - this is what happens to your code when you use recursion

00:28:35
zappy_idk: lgtm

00:28:35
<transcript>: What is this? I can't just type in chat topic building A to be a guess with the T three stack login.

00:28:40
<transcript>: Am I still fuzzy? Do I ever go fuzzy? And everyone fuzzy.

00:28:40
<transcript>: my fuzzy

00:28:42
<transcript>: My fuzzy button doesn't work.

00:28:46
zappy_idk: no

00:28:53
nikolarhristov: nah it's good

00:29:00
<transcript>: Display capture. Okay, I'm just gonna update this.

00:29:03
stroopwafel26: not any more fuzzy than usual

00:29:03
<transcript>: Nothing to see here.

00:29:03
<transcript>: nothing to see

00:29:05
<transcript>: Nothing to see.

00:29:07
<transcript>: The man behind the curtain.

00:29:07
<transcript>: remember when

00:29:07
stroopwafel26: maybe your hair

00:29:11
<transcript>: Remember when this is all I did on Stream? I just, like, built overlays.

00:29:17
<transcript>: Yeah, that was like Monday. I'm sorry.

00:29:17
<transcript>: sorry

00:29:19
<transcript>: Sorry for that. Everybody.

00:29:21
<transcript>: It's almost done.

00:29:21
fragaverage: dont remind us NotLikeThis

00:29:25
<transcript>: Oh, that one's so good. Maybe.

00:29:28
<transcript>: Or is this the one I was already on.

00:29:31
<transcript>: Okay.

00:29:35
<transcript>: Think we're good.

00:29:38
<transcript>: Surprise that with guests and with guest.

00:29:42
<transcript>: Let's try now, fuzzy.

00:29:46
<transcript>: Don't remind us. Okay, Fuzzy. Again.

00:29:47
<transcript>: No.

00:29:53
<transcript>: Stream deck. Come on now.

00:29:57
<transcript>: What's? What's the problem? Visibility show.

00:29:57
<transcript>: just

00:30:02
<transcript>: Just recent. Now it's now it knows that it's not right.

00:30:16
<transcript>: Now can we get some fuzzy so I can do secretive, sensitive things.

00:30:16
<transcript>: there

00:30:19
<transcript>: There it is. Okay, let's sign up.

00:30:19
<transcript>: with twitch

00:30:24
<transcript>: With Twitch. Oh, yeah, today I'm changing my username on Twitch, so heads up.

00:30:29
<transcript>: My username on Twitch is going to be Adam Dev.

00:30:34
<transcript>: And I'm changing that in well after the stream today.

00:30:39
<transcript>: What am I looking for? I'm looking for passwords.

00:30:41
<transcript>: Passwords.

00:30:48
<transcript>: I realize my key casters on I'm going to try not to type the password, but I'm going to search for my password on Twitch.

00:30:54
<transcript>: Copy.

00:30:57
madlep: I was just getting used to Ada Melmore

00:30:58
jenswoeste: why name change?

00:31:01
norom: the keycast is fuzzy as well

00:31:02
<transcript>: And I'm going to paste it.

00:31:02
<transcript>: here

00:31:04
<transcript>: Here.

00:31:04
<transcript>: come on page

00:31:06
<transcript>: Come on. Page isn't working.

00:31:06
<transcript>: that's not good

00:31:07
<transcript>: That's not good.

00:31:07
<transcript>: it's gonna take me

00:31:10
<transcript>: It's gonna take me forever. I'd have to actually type it too.

00:31:18
<transcript>: Why did it make me log into Twitch.

00:31:24
<transcript>: Keycast is fuzzy as well. That's true. Why the name change ends. I'm just trying to have the same.

00:31:34
<transcript>: Username on everything. And so far I've been able to get everything but GitHub. And I've reached out to the person who has a GitHub, Adam Dev because they're not very active. It's been a few years.

00:31:40
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow Beige Bruce Wayne.

00:31:46
<transcript>: Okay. We're we're trying to log in on my little panel here so I can type into chat.

00:31:46
<transcript>: nobs

00:31:52
<transcript>: Nobs and I can't copy password which is a huge bummer.

00:31:56
<transcript>: I have to paste. I have to type the password.

00:31:56
<transcript>: like it's

00:31:59
<transcript>: Like it's 1995.

00:31:59
<transcript>: and

00:32:02
<transcript>: And the clipboard hasn't been invented yet.

00:32:06
<transcript>: I'm going to just turn off keycaster for a SEC.

00:32:10
<transcript>: Okay. Even though I know, I know it's.

00:32:10
<transcript>: fuzzy

00:32:14
<transcript>: Fuzzy. I just feel better about this. Okay. This.

00:32:15
stroopwafel26: look at that ventura wallpaper

00:32:17
<transcript>: If you're listening to my keystroke.

00:32:17
<transcript>: and figuring out

00:32:20
<transcript>: And figuring out my password. You earned it.

00:32:20
<transcript>: i'll give it

00:32:22
<transcript>: I'll give it to you.

00:32:24
<transcript>: That's hard.

00:32:33
<transcript>: We got some AWS guest to build you know.

00:32:40
zappy_idk: pass: adamdotdev

00:32:41
<transcript>: I promise I'm one upgrade my Mac OS before every stream.

00:32:43
stream_kyle: hunter2

00:32:47
<transcript>: Before everyone.

00:32:48
fragaverage: whats in the new OS?

00:32:48
stroopwafel26: god

00:32:51
adamelmore: !topic building awguess with the t3 stack

00:32:53
<transcript>: All right, we did it. Topic.

00:32:53
<transcript>: building

00:32:56
<transcript>: Building A to be a guess with the T three stack.

00:32:56
<transcript>: and

00:33:01
<transcript>: And let's update the title Neovim and.

00:33:01
<transcript>: the p

00:33:02
<transcript>: The P, three.

00:33:02
<transcript>: stack

00:33:05
<transcript>: Stack building.

00:33:07
<transcript>: Building.

00:33:10
<transcript>: Of you guess okay.

00:33:17
<transcript>: So there's other things I should probably start doing at the beginning of every stream, like.

00:33:17
<transcript>: i

00:33:22
<transcript>: I should update the today and the project and whatever. Maybe those the same command actually.

00:33:28
<transcript>: Today and project. I think those are the same. Okay, I can turn on keycaster again.

00:33:35
<transcript>: There's keycaster and I can unfuzzy oh, no, I can't. I got to move my domain real quick.

00:33:35
<transcript>: aws

00:33:37
<transcript>: Aws.com, manage.

00:33:43
<transcript>: I just want to have it ready so that we it's time we can just do the thing right.

00:33:47
<transcript>: Let's custom DNS.

00:33:47
<transcript>: name shake

00:33:49
<transcript>: Name Shake Yeah.

00:33:55
<transcript>: I'm actually point the name servers. I don't know why they don't recommend doing that, but I'm gonna do that.

00:33:58
fragaverage: vercel?

00:33:59
<transcript>: Just feels weird to use the.

00:33:59
<transcript>: name ch

00:34:04
<transcript>: Name, Chief, Name servers. I always put these on, like Route 53.

00:34:09
<transcript>: Versail. Yeah, frag, do I say something else.

00:34:12
<transcript>: What's in the new OS? I don't know.

00:34:12
<transcript>: pass

00:34:15
<transcript>: Password? Adam Dev.

00:34:20
archiethedev: what's awguess gonna be!

00:34:33
fragaverage: gotcha

00:34:34
<transcript>: Yeah, the Venture wallpapers. Nice. So what's in the new OS the only reason I upgraded was it fixed an OBS 28 bug. For me, they clearly they were kind of like keeping an eye on Mac OS X 13 Ventura when they were building OBS 28. And there was a couple features that only work on.

00:34:34
<transcript>: ventura

00:34:40
<transcript>: Ventura for audio routing. I haven't figured out how to make that one work, but it fixed a screen capture thing.

00:34:40
<transcript>: that was having

00:34:42
<transcript>: That was having yesterday.

00:34:42
<transcript>: they've got

00:34:48
fragaverage: the screenkit thing?

00:34:51
<transcript>: They've got a new system, more performance screen capture for Mac, and I couldn't use it unless I upgraded to Ventura. So here we are. Should be more professional. Does it feel more performant.

00:34:51
<transcript>: does my screen share

00:34:56
<transcript>: Does my screen share look clearer or something? I don't know something about it. Better.

00:35:02
stroopwafel26: it's in 120 fps now

00:35:03
<transcript>: I'm still fuzzy. Right. So does that look clear? How about these? All these little boxes? Pretty clear. Alright, good.

00:35:08
<transcript>: Yeah. The screen kit thing exactly. It's a high hundred 20 frame.

00:35:21
<transcript>: Okay, I've moved it over. It says my domain is properly configured. You don't have a production deployment. Well, yeah, that makes sense. We haven't actually pushed this thing to GitHub. Okay.

00:35:24
<transcript>: Unfuzzy. Here we go.

00:35:24
<transcript>: t three

00:35:34
<transcript>: T three, and I hope next Will shows up because I know nothing about the T three stack. We're still learning most everything about the T three stack. I'm going to open up.

00:35:34
<transcript>: plan

00:35:36
<transcript>: Planet scale.

00:35:38
<transcript>: Because we do have our.

00:35:41
stroopwafel26: ventura has a new system preferences screen that's less than optimal, all i know :P

00:35:43
<transcript>: Planet Scale database here where we're going to store stuff.

00:35:43
<transcript>: we're getting the whole

00:35:55
<transcript>: We're getting the whole experience. Normally I build with DynamoDB, which is a NoSQL database. I hate that word NonSQL, but it's a NoSQL database. So we're getting an SQL database experience today. It's been like a five years, something.

00:36:01
<transcript>: All right, I want to rename this database because it drives me crazy.

00:36:01
<transcript>: we were gonna

00:36:09
<transcript>: We were gonna build Blurtle, then we didn't, and now we're building. Aws, can I not just rename it? Uhoh, name copy change is using X to the database. Uhoh.

00:36:16
madlep: There needs to be a neovim plugin to do obs inside neovim. Text mode. With ascii animations and stuff instead of videos

00:36:17
<transcript>: Delete the database. Then we're starting over. How big a deal was this? I don't remember what all do we have to do? It was just like.

00:36:19
<transcript>: Prisma.

00:36:25
<transcript>: Sink or something, right? We just like, MPX Prison or something. I think it's fine. There's nothing in it.

00:36:27
<transcript>: That we can.

00:36:30
stroopwafel26: Why is it NoSQL, but also serverless? Should be NoServers

00:36:38
<transcript>: I do need to kill this proxy because now the proxy is going to be connect.

00:36:40
<transcript>: Aw guess.

00:36:42
<transcript>: So new database.

00:36:47
<transcript>: Aw guess.

00:36:47
<transcript>: north

00:36:48
<transcript>: North.

00:36:48
<transcript>: northern

00:36:52
<transcript>: Northern Virginia, it's good. Create database.

00:36:53
fragaverage: @stroopwafel26 🤦🏼‍♂️

00:36:55
<transcript>: And then we need to.

00:36:58
<transcript>: Do that schema sync thing.

00:37:03
<transcript>: I think that was all we did. Anyone remember? Do we do anything else.

00:37:07
fragaverage: npx prisma db push

00:37:16
<transcript>: No servers that's more accurate. Has a new system Preferences screen. That's less and optimal. Yet that's all. That's all I've noticed so far. And it apparently won't let me control the keyboard.

00:37:19
<transcript>: With my overlays, which is a bummer.

00:37:27
<transcript>: Needs to be a new event plugin to do OBS inside Neovem text mode with Ask animations and stuff instead of videos. That sounds awesome.

00:37:34
<transcript>: Impact Prisma DB Push is that what it is.

00:37:34
<transcript>: all right

00:37:38
<transcript>: All right. Input Prisma. I guess I need to be in my project.

00:37:49
<transcript>: Oh, I got to do the this thing.

00:37:53
<transcript>: Now let's try that.

00:37:56
stroopwafel26: do you use pure prompt?

00:38:02
<transcript>: Known database Blurtle. That makes sense. The database is no longer called Blurtle. So let's see.

00:38:02
<transcript>: where

00:38:04
<transcript>: Where is.

00:38:07
<transcript>: Myrtle.

00:38:11
<transcript>: No mentions of Blurtle. Oh, it's in the Connection strength.

00:38:11
<transcript>: again

00:38:12
<transcript>: Again.

00:38:12
<transcript>: no i

00:38:17
<transcript>: No, I don't do I'm gonna open the.

00:38:25
<transcript>: In file and I guess I gotta change the database URL. I don't have a way of seeing what the database URL is.

00:38:35
<transcript>: Pure prompt. Stoop. What is pure prompt? Sounds fancy. I don't use it.

00:38:42
<transcript>: Prisma with Planet Scale. Here we go. Quick, start. Am I fuzzy? Yeah, Yeah.

00:38:44
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:38:46
<transcript>: Set of branches.

00:38:52
<transcript>: I need to create a new brand.

00:38:52
<transcript>: maybe

00:38:53
<transcript>: Maybe.

00:38:55
stroopwafel26: for your cli, looks like pure https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure

00:38:57
<transcript>: Initialize Prisma.

00:39:07
<transcript>: Okay, so that's the database URL. Oh, it's just. It's simple. It's not even sensitive.

00:39:07
<transcript>: it's just

00:39:13
<transcript>: It's just gonna be that. And then the database name, which is, AW, guess.

00:39:15
<transcript>: Easy.

00:39:15
<transcript>: too easy

00:39:16
<transcript>: Too easy.

00:39:24
<transcript>: And that doesn't.

00:39:28
<transcript>: Okay.

00:39:30
<transcript>: Then paste this.

00:39:34
<transcript>: Cool.

00:39:38
<transcript>: Save it.

00:39:39
caldotjs: starship >>>

00:39:45
<transcript>: Looks right root at one. Yeah. Okay.

00:39:47
<transcript>: And then I need to.

00:39:52
<transcript>: Let's see restart the dead server probably.

00:39:57
<transcript>: Oops.

00:39:57
<transcript>: arrow

00:39:59
<transcript>: Arrow on to go.

00:40:02
stroopwafel26: pure is starship but a little more minimal which i like

00:40:03
<transcript>: Let's just open index or something. Okay.

00:40:03
<transcript>: restart

00:40:06
<transcript>: Restart the Dev server and to do that.

00:40:10
<transcript>: Database URL not sensitive.

00:40:13
<transcript>: I'm going to.

00:40:22
<transcript>: Tmux still remembering TMUK stuff. It was two days ago, so I need to switch over to.

00:40:22
<transcript>: that

00:40:28
<transcript>: That thing. There we go. And then to navigate. Let's see. I'm on this one. I need to do.

00:40:31
<transcript>: Restart.

00:40:35
<transcript>: I don't even know if I need to restart. I think I do because environment variables. Right.

00:40:35
<transcript>: then

00:40:38
<transcript>: Then I can go over here.

00:40:38
<transcript>: and i can

00:40:41
<transcript>: And I can try to migrate the database gas right.

00:40:46
<transcript>: It works. It worked. Okay, cool.

00:40:52
<transcript>: And then what was the Prisma Studio thing is like Prisma Studio, just like that.

00:40:55
<transcript>: Oh, latent. We'll see. I don't think.

00:40:55
<transcript>: anything's

00:41:01
<transcript>: Anything's working right now. The keyboard commands aren't being picked up. I'll put it on there for you.

00:41:01
<transcript>: let's do this

00:41:03
<transcript>: Let's do this manually.

00:41:04
<transcript>: Like this.

00:41:08
<transcript>: How do you partner? There I am.

00:41:12
<transcript>: Okay? Oh, Whoa.

00:41:12
<transcript>: why is it

00:41:14
<transcript>: Why is it Uhoh.

00:41:17
<transcript>: My new.

00:41:17
<transcript>: so that's

00:41:19
<transcript>: So that's not gonna work.

00:41:19
<transcript>: why is that

00:41:21
<transcript>: Why is that.

00:41:21
<transcript>: what is it meaning

00:41:21
norom: LUL

00:41:22
<transcript>: What is it? Meaning.

00:41:22
stream_kyle: Have you heard about or tried out Stable Diffusion?

00:41:25
<transcript>: I don't understand.

00:41:31
<transcript>: Stable diffusion. I have heard a stable diffusion. It's one of those things I've just heard about.

00:41:34
laytanl_: SeemsGood

00:41:37
<transcript>: It's like.

00:41:37
<transcript>: open

00:41:40
caldotjs: @stroopwafel26 isn't pure written in shellscript and starship in rust & shell

00:41:42
<transcript>: Open AI but you install it on your Mac laden is that what you're going for.

00:41:46
<transcript>: Pure Starship with a little more minimal which I like.

00:41:51
fragaverage: what is going on with this overlay LUL

00:41:51
<transcript>: For your CLI. Looks like pure.

00:41:57
<transcript>: Like for my emulator. Is that what it or is it the it's the prompt.

00:42:00
<transcript>: Okay. I'm gonna turn this off. Now.

00:42:03
stroopwafel26: the prompt yeah

00:42:13
<transcript>: Those don't get messed up somehow. Weirdly. Those used to get messed up. But the new Chroma filter really doesn't like the cowboy hat. So we're gonna put the glasses on instead.

00:42:13
<transcript>: the

00:42:20
<transcript>: The prompt. What is? What is it? Do what is going on? The overlay frag. I don't know. I really don't know. We installed the new macOS.

00:42:20
<transcript>: and

00:42:29
<transcript>: And there's some things we got to work through some quirks, but we're gonna focus on, AW, guess because I got a lot to build.

00:42:32
fragaverage: "things" and other "things"

00:42:33
stream_kyle: I've seen some pretty cool results from it.

00:42:34
laytanl_: Everytime you say you won't work on the overlay it just bugs out

00:42:34
fragaverage: alright go, focus

00:42:36
stroopwafel26: ventura upgrade is going great MaxLOL

00:42:36
<transcript>: And maybe just save your channel points today. Maybe just save them up. Don't spend them because I don't know if it'll work, if you spend them.

00:42:43
<transcript>: Everything you say won't work on the overlay it just bugs out.

00:42:48
<transcript>: Oh, every time? Yeah? Every time I say I won't? Yeah? Focus? Here we go.

00:42:48
<transcript>: venture upgrades

00:42:51
caldotjs: @stroopwafel26 now I am confused adamel4Animadam

00:42:58
<transcript>: Venture upgrades going great. So I'm slow because I'm trying to remember Team X. So I gotta go previous like that. There we are. Okay? We're in our we're in our.

00:43:04
<transcript>: Tea tree app and what do we need to do? We need to add some.

00:43:08
<transcript>: A router. We have our game router. We started doing this.

00:43:12
<transcript>: So we've got a game which has and we're gonna store all these.

00:43:12
<transcript>: actually go

00:43:14
stroopwafel26: @stroopwafel26 that's right

00:43:16
<transcript>: Actually go on our schema. Right. Maybe I should start there. Actually.

00:43:21
<transcript>: Prisma.

00:43:25
<transcript>: Let's start here because I think ultimately, we're gonna create.

00:43:28
<transcript>: We're gonna create.

00:43:30
caldotjs: @stroopwafel26 good :D

00:43:39
<transcript>: Models for these things. We're gonna store every game in our table. If we think about the I started a drawdrop. If we think about the.

00:43:42
<transcript>: Architecture of this thing.

00:43:46
<transcript>: It's the one that's.

00:43:56
<transcript>: So this is what the game's gonna look like. It's gonna have, like, a picture of an AWS service icon, some options and I timer.

00:44:01
<transcript>: And we kind of started mapping out what the schema looks like. High level.

00:44:01
<transcript>: so

00:44:05
<transcript>: So every game has multiple rounds.

00:44:05
<transcript>: but i think

00:44:09
<transcript>: But I think we need to get ahead of, like the architecture in terms of.

00:44:15
<transcript>: Multiplayer. I think we just need to go ahead and get ahead of that because I don't want to build it. If it's not multiplayer, it sounds dumb.

00:44:19
<transcript>: So do we want to do.

00:44:19
<transcript>: what we'll

00:44:21
<transcript>: What? We'll.

00:44:27
<transcript>: Somebody sent this and this person use they made a ticket.

00:44:31
<transcript>: They use something for multiplayer. What did they use.

00:44:34
<transcript>: Source.

00:44:36
stroopwafel26: peerjs

00:44:40
<transcript>: Somebody said they used Pierrejs. Let's look up pure JS.

00:44:40
<transcript>: i'm assuming

00:44:42
<transcript>: I'm assuming by the name.

00:44:42
<transcript>: simple

00:44:44
<transcript>: Simple PeerToPeer with web RTC.

00:45:04
<transcript>: Complete configureable and easy to use peer to computer Connection API equipped in nothing but an ID appear can create a PGP data or media stream connection to a remote Pier. So I guess do I want it to be okay to broker connections? Pure JS connects to a peer server. Note that no peer to peer data goes through the server server server acts only as a connection broker.

00:45:04
<transcript>: i feel like

00:45:07
<transcript>: I feel like I actually want this to be more of, like.

00:45:09
<transcript>: They're connected to the server.

00:45:09
<transcript>: ne

00:45:13
stroopwafel26: I tried peerjs yesterday and even I could get it working lmao

00:45:16
<transcript>: Neither peer can calculate if the answer was right. We're not going to ship the answer to the browser, right. So I think.

00:45:21
<transcript>: Even you could get it working Stroop. Well, in that case.

00:45:26
<transcript>: No, I think.

00:45:26
<transcript>: i want to look at

00:45:28
laytanl_: I think you want a server in between yeah

00:45:34
<transcript>: I want to look at replicas too. It might be way. Not what we need, but somebody said something about it for real time.

00:45:34
<transcript>: the next web

00:45:38
<transcript>: The next web is multiplayer. Oh, this does sound like what I need.

00:45:38
<transcript>: joshkri

00:45:45
<transcript>: Joshkrip Library for building high performance, offline, capable, collaborative Web apps, check out a video of our demo app, Ripleyer, or try it yourself.

00:45:47
stroopwafel26: I'm definitely not a developer

00:45:48
karrbs: there is also supabase

00:45:49
laytanl_: sockets should do fine right

00:45:53
<transcript>: Benefits real time collaboration Users see each other's changes live as they happen. No free shut, no refreshes, no locking.

00:46:00
<transcript>: Instant UI the UI response instantly with no server round trips. All reads and rights are optimistic by default.

00:46:11
fragaverage: does the users UI care about other players until the results screen?

00:46:12
<transcript>: Okay. Your data stationary service. I think it just works, too. On, like Versailles, right? Is where I've seen this thing pumped by Gearmo. He's probably an investor. He invest in everything.

00:46:14
<transcript>: Once you go to bed.

00:46:16
<transcript>: First quote.

00:46:27
<transcript>: Now watch this. Let's just. I just. I'm positive. I don't know. Maybe I've already even seen it. I don't think I have do they have their list of investors? I would just guarantee.

00:46:27
<transcript>: the gueraml

00:46:28
<transcript>: The gueraml.

00:46:30
<transcript>: Replicas.

00:46:38
<transcript>: Michael, stopwoman.

00:46:42
<transcript>: Replicas.

00:46:42
<transcript>: this is

00:46:45
<transcript>: This is dumb. I don't need to do this. I'm trying to put my.

00:46:45
<transcript>: point you know

00:46:47
<transcript>: Point you know.

00:46:47
<transcript>: i

00:46:48
<transcript>: I.

00:46:55
<transcript>: 'll See who this person is? They must be invested in replicas.

00:46:59
<transcript>: I can just pull up replica on like.

00:47:03
<transcript>: Replicas Crunch Base or something.

00:47:03
<transcript>: or angel

00:47:06
<transcript>: Or Angelus? What's the place? Where you just. Yeah, here we go.

00:47:10
texoport: crunchbase?

00:47:11
<transcript>: Funding coming.

00:47:15
<transcript>: There's no public funding date. I'm sure I'm positive.

00:47:15
<transcript>: that

00:47:17
<transcript>: That.

00:47:19
<transcript>: Gamma is an investor.

00:47:19
<transcript>: okay

00:47:20
<transcript>: Okay anyway.

00:47:24
cowfacedude99: how's tmux treating you?

00:47:26
<transcript>: This sounds great. I think this is singing that I want, right.

00:47:26
<transcript>: pretty use

00:47:33
<transcript>: Pretty use for noncorcial projects and for companies with less than 200,000. That'll be us. This is us.

00:47:39
<transcript>: It will be noncommercial and it will definitely have less than 2000 in revenue. It will have exactly $0 in revenue.

00:47:39
<transcript>: first

00:47:43
<transcript>: First two months of free. Okay, let's do it. Get started.

00:47:56
<transcript>: The easiest way to start is to clone our starter app. This sets up a fully functioning app using next year's TypeScript and Postgres. Well, that's not gonna work for us. We've already got a repo, right.

00:47:59
<transcript>: So let's let's not do that.

00:48:05
<transcript>: Next Public Replicas license key.

00:48:06
<transcript>: Oh no.

00:48:06
<transcript>: oh no

00:48:09
<transcript>: Oh, no, my mouse pad.

00:48:09
<transcript>: so i

00:48:13
<transcript>: So I get if we're using a mask, that's the plug it in, I guess.

00:48:29
<transcript>: Fingers crossed. But it's not a.

00:48:29
<transcript>: venture

00:48:31
<transcript>: Venture a bug.

00:48:35
<transcript>: Just killed my trackpad. Hopefully it's just the battery.

00:48:43
<transcript>: This gonna look so bad on my brake view just can't take any breaks today.

00:48:47
<transcript>: Okay.

00:48:51
<transcript>: Got it back so we have to get a license key.

00:48:55
<transcript>: Mpx replicas get license.

00:48:57
<transcript>: I should go fuzzy for this.

00:48:59
stroopwafel26: magic trackpad has such a long battery life that you sometimes forget it even has a battery

00:49:01
<transcript>: Should definitely go fuzzy for this.

00:49:03
<transcript>: Here we are.

00:49:15
<transcript>: Yeah, I forget. Oh, Cafes team Looks is so great. I don't know if I thank you profusely enough on the last stream, but thank you so much Cafes, for taking the time set me up with tmux. I'm loving it.

00:49:15
<transcript>: i get it

00:49:15
laytanl_: everytime my mouse needs to recharge I make it an exercise to do everything with the keyboard

00:49:16
<transcript>: I get it now.

00:49:16
<transcript>: i get

00:49:20
<transcript>: I get why everyone says it's the best.

00:49:27
<transcript>: Okay, install that. My name is Adamar, the company project.

00:49:27
<transcript>: org name

00:49:29
<transcript>: Org. Name or URL. Well.

<transcript>: let's just

00:49:33
<transcript>: Let's just say AW Guess.com.

00:49:33
<transcript>: yes

00:49:35
<transcript>: Yes.

00:49:37
<transcript>: Contact, email.

00:49:42
<transcript>: Work is your project commercial is the first.

00:49:42
<transcript>: time

00:49:43
<transcript>: Time, service.

00:49:49
<transcript>: No. If it doesn't make money, it's not commercial, right? Any lawyers in the Twitch chat.

00:49:52
<transcript>: Anybody. I don't think it's commercial.

00:49:58
<transcript>: Dude, do you agree to the rep cache terms of service.

00:49:58
<transcript>: yes

00:50:00
<transcript>: Yes.

00:50:00
<transcript>: cool

00:50:02
<transcript>: Cool, I got a lot of license key.

00:50:07
<transcript>: Okay. So I need to add this.

00:50:10
<transcript>: Is that copying it.

00:50:15
<transcript>: I don't know how my clipboard works anymore.

00:50:22
<transcript>: Teammates. That's the one thing I don't know. Cafes in Tmax. Is there like a secret.

00:50:22
<transcript>: to

00:50:23
cowfacedude99: I am a wired guy on the desk, more clutter but no worries of stuff draining

00:50:25
<transcript>: To copy the line.

00:50:25
<transcript>: to

00:50:26
<transcript>: To.

00:50:35
<transcript>: The clipboard because it does seem to be broken. I can't copy and paste things. Maybe that's a feature, but like could I.

00:50:43
<transcript>: Undo that feature because I'd like to be able to paste. I don't know how to paste.

00:50:48
stream_kyle: I can pretend to be a lawyer, but like a lawyer I have to remind you that I'm pretending to be a lawyer, not pretending to be *your* lawyer.

00:50:48
madlep: there's a reattach clipboard plugin.

00:50:48
<transcript>: I don't want to write that out.

00:50:54
<transcript>: There's a reattached clipboard plugin. Sounds good.

00:50:54
<transcript>: timux

00:50:57
<transcript>: Timux Mac OS clipboard.

00:50:57
<transcript>: i have to

00:51:00
<transcript>: I have to be able to copy this thing into my.

00:51:12
madlep: not built in, which is a "feature", so you need to set it up as a thing

00:51:14
<transcript>: If you're using iterm, you can copy text and TMUK session holding down the option key while dragging the mouse. Make selection. This is not iterm.

00:51:23
<transcript>: If you use the terminal app, you can switch off mask rule and use usual copy paste.

00:51:36
<transcript>: You need to set it up to the thing. I'm cool with doing that. If we need to add a plugin to tmux, I'd be fine with that.

00:51:41
<transcript>: And the following.

00:51:50
cowfacedude99: forgot about this one https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-yank

00:51:53
<transcript>: The kindly decided to change commence bind key copy mode mouse drag end one panes and X copy pipe and cancel piece.

00:51:53
<transcript>: is that what

00:51:54
<transcript>: Is that what you all do.

00:51:59
<transcript>: Forgot about this one. Okay, much Yank. That sounds good.

00:51:59
<transcript>: that's what i want

00:52:04
<transcript>: That's what I want to do right now. I want to yank. Sorry. I'm unsuzzy. There's just a very sensitive thing on the screen.

00:52:04
<transcript>: so i can't

00:52:07
<transcript>: So I can't show you yet.

00:52:07
<transcript>: tim

00:52:14
madlep: I've got this setup: `bind-key -Tcopy-mode-vi 'y' send -X copy-pipe "reattach-to-user-namespace pbcopy"`

00:52:18
<transcript>: Timox plugin for copying to System Clipboard works on OS X, Linux and Siduan. Okay via TPM recommended. This is how I'm going to install it just like that.

00:52:18
<transcript>: let's open up

00:52:23
<transcript>: Let's open up our T Max. Comps, and then Team X.

00:52:28
<transcript>: Go to the bottom.

00:52:31
<transcript>: Let's add this plugin.

00:52:36
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:52:38
<transcript>: I'll add it here.

00:52:38
<transcript>: okay

00:52:40
<transcript>: Okay.

00:52:40
<transcript>: t max yank

00:52:46
<transcript>: T Max yank and I need to use prefix I in stall, so I need to reload this. Save this.

00:52:51
<transcript>: Reload it and then I need to do.

00:52:54
<transcript>: I for install.

00:52:54
<transcript>: installing

00:53:02
<transcript>: Installing Pmux ink. And you want to update too much Yankees prefects you and it makes sense. Okay, I installed it now. Do I need to do something.

00:53:05
dizzyd125: morning

00:53:07
<transcript>: For the work doesn't hurt I've been solved.

00:53:10
<transcript>: Okay.

00:53:12
<transcript>: Mojave.

00:53:12
<transcript>: catalina

00:53:16
cowfacedude99: try if ti works

00:53:18
<transcript>: Catalina Easiest way to use Reattach to usernamespace with T Max is to use the TMX Sensible plugin.

00:53:24
<transcript>: To use it manually.

00:53:28
<transcript>: Oh, I need to install something that's Homebrew as well. Looks like.

00:53:36
<transcript>: Good morning, Disney. Welcome to Chat. First time Chatter welcome.

00:53:47
<transcript>: I have to actually install something. Is that what it's saying? In order for team except stores data in the system clipboard. Okay.

00:53:48
cowfacedude99: pbcopy should be on your system by default

00:53:48
<transcript>: So.

00:53:54
<transcript>: I can install its Homebrew.

00:53:59
<transcript>: This thing.

00:53:59
<transcript>: install

00:54:01
<transcript>: Install reattach. Okay.

00:54:04
<transcript>: Username space.

00:54:08
madlep: Yeah, is a brew install

00:54:14
<transcript>: And then key bindings normal mode prefix y copies text from the command line to the clipboard. Works with all popular shells, right.

00:54:14
<transcript>: okay

00:54:16
<transcript>: Okay.

00:54:16
<transcript>: prefix

00:54:17
<transcript>: Prefix.

00:54:17
<transcript>: y copy

00:54:23
<transcript>: Y copy the current Pain's current working directory to the clipboard. Oh, so capital Y versus okay.

00:54:23
<transcript>: copy mode

00:54:29
<transcript>: Copy mode. Copy selection. Two system clipboard. So if I'm in copy mode, what's copy mode.

00:54:37
<transcript>: Oh yeah. Pv copy is on my system. Can I just use PV copy.

00:54:41
<transcript>: I didn't see that PB copy.

00:54:44
cowfacedude99: it works with mouse

00:54:48
<transcript>: Doesn't mention it in the README. Does it just fall back? The Phoebe copy.

00:54:59
madlep: pbcopy is a macos system util

00:55:03
<transcript>: Be cool, and I have another thing I did install. I already installed it. But take this in the future. When I reformat my machine, I'm thinking about reforming my machine just like starting from scratch, because I'd love to never install Docker on my machine for one. That'd be great.

00:55:08
<transcript>: Works with Mouse. Okay.

00:55:10
madlep: reattach-to-user-namespace pipes what you copied to that I think

00:55:10
cowfacedude99: you don't need to worry about copy mode.

00:55:13
<transcript>: So.

00:55:13
<transcript>: config

00:55:15
<transcript>: Configuration. I have to actually configure something.

00:55:15
<transcript>: default

00:55:27
<transcript>: Default and preferred Clipboard program TMX. Jenk does its best to detect a reasonable choice for a Clipboard program on your list. If Timok's Yank can't detect a known Clipboard program that uses the custom code, so I better just works with PB. Copyright.

00:55:30
<transcript>: feeling it probably just works

00:55:36
<transcript>: Only work in TMX's built in mouse for is also enabled. I think I have that. Yeah.

00:55:42
<transcript>: Okay. So let's just try this. I'm gonna go back into my.

00:55:46
<transcript>: Oh, no? Did I lose my.

00:55:54
<transcript>: Key.

00:55:59
<transcript>: I'm trying to copy. Let's see.

00:56:04
<transcript>: Copy.

00:56:12
<transcript>: That doesn't work. But I have to do the Yank thing. Leader. Yank.

00:56:17
<transcript>: So I select I can even like select stuff I don't know.

00:56:21
<transcript>: I mean trying to use the mouse.

00:56:21
<transcript>: because i'm

00:56:25
<transcript>: Because I'm I don't know how else to do it.

00:56:29
<transcript>: Select.

00:56:34
<transcript>: Come on.

00:56:38
<transcript>: I guess just a line and standard out or whatever in my terminal.

00:56:38
<transcript>: how do i

00:56:41
<transcript>: How do I copy it? Copy line.

00:56:45
<transcript>: Paste line.

00:56:45
<transcript>: oh

00:56:48
<transcript>: Oh, I did it. It's in my clipboard.

00:56:53
<transcript>: It's there. I don't know why it started working. I just did the same thing backtoback.

00:56:53
<transcript>: you were using mac

00:56:55
<transcript>: You were using Mac OS 13.

00:56:55
<transcript>: we do not

00:57:02
<transcript>: We do not provide support for this prerelease version. You will encounter build failures with some formula Bruce complaining.

00:57:04
<transcript>: Well.

00:57:07
<transcript>: Hope this works.

00:57:14
<transcript>: Okay. I'm almost done on Fuzzy. We're gonna go to normal here very shortly. You don't need to worry about copy mode, okay.

00:57:22
<transcript>: So I'm back over here. I'm going to open up.

00:57:22
<transcript>: my

00:57:27
<transcript>: My INF file, and I'm going to add this secret.

00:57:33
<transcript>: We're gonna call it replicas. Pretty excited about building this. Get to play with replicas.

00:57:36
<transcript>: Next.

00:57:38
cowfacedude99: it worked on me out of the box when I had set it up in jan on my work system

00:57:41
<transcript>: Public. This goes to the client, I guess replicas.

00:57:44
<transcript>: Lightning.

00:57:45
<transcript>: Key.

00:57:45
<transcript>: equals

00:57:47
<transcript>: Equals.

00:57:50
<transcript>: Is done.

00:57:50
<transcript>: okay

00:57:51
<transcript>: Okay.

00:57:51
<transcript>: done

00:57:53
<transcript>: Done, and I can unfuzzy.

00:57:53
<transcript>: because

00:57:55
<transcript>: Because.

00:58:02
<transcript>: Late. Thank you so much. Laden for cloak. Look at this. You can't see what's in my secrets.

00:58:02
<transcript>: latent

00:58:03
<transcript>: Latent.

00:58:04
stroopwafel26: @madlep yes

00:58:05
<transcript>: Big cloak. And it's awesome.

00:58:09
<transcript>: Coke NVM Check it out on GitHub.

00:58:09
<transcript>: okay

00:58:10
<transcript>: Okay.

00:58:17
<transcript>: It works for you out of the box. Okay, so I may not have needed to install that second thing we'll see when I.

00:58:17
<transcript>: restart my

00:58:22
<transcript>: Restart my machine when I boot it from scratch and I try to build all this back up.

00:58:24
karrbs: So you use plan OBS or a different software

00:58:27
<transcript>: I'd like to get my dot files in order.

00:58:27
<transcript>: i can

00:58:29
<transcript>: I can copy all this stuff.

00:58:32
karrbs: do you*

00:58:40
<transcript>: Into a single dot file repo. I'm gonna get rid of all my custom fish stuff that I had set up. I'm just gonna start using Zsh and all my Zsh by default. Just like Dracula. That's the only thing I care.

00:58:48
<transcript>: Yeah. So I'm gonna probably do that. Maybe tomorrow. I don't think I'm gonna stream tomorrow. I've just got a few hours and we're going out of town, taking a little mini vacation.

00:58:54
<transcript>: I'll be back Wednesday, next Week's, next Week on The Stream Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, which is kind of weird.

00:58:54
<transcript>: i won't be here

00:58:56
<transcript>: I won't be here Monday and Tuesday.

00:59:01
<transcript>: And I don't normally stream on Wednesday, so I'll beat the schedule. How about that.

00:59:05
<transcript>: Plane. Obs, or different software. It is it's OBS.

00:59:05
<transcript>: that's right

00:59:06
<transcript>: That's right.

00:59:08
<transcript>: And.

00:59:15
<transcript>: Yeah we're on macOS 13 now and OBS 28 so some things.

00:59:15
<transcript>: some things

00:59:18
<transcript>: Some things aren't working.

00:59:25
<transcript>: Okay. So we've done this. We have our Gitlicense, we have our license key in this environment. Variable.

00:59:34
<transcript>: Okay. But what if I want to build this up from scratch? What if I can't use your quick start read, though? Because.

00:59:49
<transcript>: What symbol but fully functional repercussion app built with Next JS. So I'm not just have to look at this repo and sort of like Reverse engineer. There's not like a add it to your existing app thing.

00:59:49
<transcript>: features

00:59:54
<transcript>: Features Abstract Your first case Feature Next step.

00:59:55
stroopwafel26: I'm even happier with tmux now that I finally had an excuse to get dracula colors in there :P

00:59:56
<transcript>: How to.

01:00:01
<transcript>: Integrate with your own back end work with Blogs Launch the production.

01:00:04
<transcript>: Examples.

01:00:07
<transcript>: Understand replicas.

01:00:12
<transcript>: Features.

01:00:22
<transcript>: App, structure.

01:00:22
<transcript>: few key bits

01:00:23
<transcript>: Few key bits.

01:00:23
<transcript>: to do

01:00:28
<transcript>: To do any mutators defines replicas mutators for the to do app.

01:00:28
<transcript>: they run

01:00:39
<transcript>: They run twice, first immediately and optimistically on the client, then later authoritatively on the server replac automatically reconciles differences between the optimistic and the sort. Data wrap rounds continuously on all clients.

01:00:42
<transcript>: Okay.

01:00:45
<transcript>: I guess we're going to pull up this.

01:00:49
<transcript>: We're gonna pull up this example repo, aren't we.

01:00:49
<transcript>: probably make

01:00:51
<transcript>: Probably make sense.

01:00:54
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:00:59
<transcript>: I think there was an examples. Maybe there's a better example that fits.

01:00:59
<transcript>: our

01:01:01
<transcript>: Our repolear. It's like linear.

01:01:01
<transcript>: probably

01:01:05
<transcript>: Probably like project manager and then Rip withdraw.

01:01:09
<transcript>: Let's just call ours. The Todo app sounds like the default.

01:01:12
<transcript>: So let's look at the code.

01:01:24
<transcript>: Super fast offline first implementation of todo MVC built with replicas next JS and Postgres.

01:01:31
<transcript>: Simplest possible starter sample for up cash intended for customers to clone and start editing. Cool. Okay.

01:01:35
<transcript>: I'm just gonna start with.

01:01:39
<transcript>: The next config. Make sure it's not something weird in here.

01:01:43
<transcript>: Okay, now.

01:01:50
<transcript>: What about oh, let's do this thing right after clone it, but I can get all the benefits of like vs. Code.

01:01:55
<transcript>: Because if you recall, I haven't always been a neo Vemmer.

01:01:55
<transcript>: i was

01:02:00
<transcript>: I was a vs coder for five years before I tried new event a few weeks ago.

01:02:00
<transcript>: we're not

01:02:04
<transcript>: We're not going back, but this is nice. Just be able to do this right.

01:02:04
<transcript>: so package

01:02:08
<transcript>: So package JSON. So the dependencies. Let's see here.

01:02:08
<transcript>: engine

01:02:10
<transcript>: Engines would.

01:02:20
<transcript>: Oh, they're deploying this on render. Oh, am I not gonna be able to deploy replicas on Versaille? Maybe not, maybe not.

01:02:23
<transcript>: We'll find out.

01:02:30
<transcript>: Okay dependencies next.

01:02:30
<transcript>: replicas

01:02:34
<transcript>: Replicas, replication, XJS, and replicas react.

01:02:36
<transcript>: Okay.

01:02:40
<transcript>: No other dependencies that I see.

01:02:40
<transcript>: and

01:02:42
<transcript>: And then let's open.

01:02:47
<transcript>: Render. Yeah, I don't want to run this on some other service.

01:02:50
<transcript>: I guess we have to have a server.

01:02:50
<transcript>: we'll see

01:02:53
<transcript>: We'll see. Maybe we will use render. I've just never used render.

01:03:05
<transcript>: Hi.

01:03:20
<transcript>: Environment variable. So this is our render YAML. Let's see, let's look at.

01:03:25
<transcript>: Components pages so that index page.

01:03:29
<transcript>: Create space replicas. Next JS. Lib backend.

01:03:29
<transcript>: so it's

01:03:35
<transcript>: So it's got a get service ID. Props. Okay, so it's SSR. I don't love that.

01:03:43
<transcript>: Randomly generate a new list ID and create a space for its data server side, and redirect to list ID.

01:03:49
<transcript>: Okay. I guess I should play. Let's play with this thing. It's deployed here.

01:03:57
<transcript>: See what the functionality looks like. So we a little better understand? Maybe. Okay. So it created a random list.

01:04:00
laytanl_: Why do you need something like this? All communication is client initiated right?

01:04:01
<transcript>: This ID here. And I guess you all could go to this.

01:04:02
adamelmore: https://replicache-todo.vercel.app/list/3Fv4RP

01:04:10
<transcript>: Leighton, Why do I need something like this? All communication is client initiated.

01:04:13
laytanl_: no need to push updates to client

01:04:13
<transcript>: So it's gonna be multiplayer.

01:04:13
<transcript>: we're

01:04:15
<transcript>: We're gonna have.

01:04:19
<transcript>: You competing with someone else, right? Oh, look at that.

01:04:19
<transcript>: so this is

01:04:24
<transcript>: So this is all like, I'm live multiple people doing things on this.

01:04:26
<transcript>: By Friday.

01:04:35
<transcript>: Does that make sense late. So if it were solo, if or just you doing it yourself, we would just do it all an API wrap, but we want this to be.

01:04:35
<transcript>: multiplayer

01:04:39
laytanl_: Oh I thought you were going to use it for leaderboards

01:04:45
laytanl_: which would be overkill

01:04:50
<transcript>: Multiplayer. So we're gonna have two people competeing into each other to see who can get the services fastest. Maybe we'll even, like, show their mouses. I don't know if we can do that, but like, you see each other's mouth. So you know, like if they're hovering on one or something? I don't know.

01:04:50
<transcript>: i thought we were going

01:04:58
<transcript>: I thought we were going to use it for leaderboards. Oh, no, no, yeah, no leaderboards. We could build without something like this. This is for the more multiplayer aspects of it.

01:05:01
<transcript>: Okay.

01:05:01
<transcript>: so

01:05:04
<transcript>: So it creates a random space.

01:05:04
<transcript>: uses nano

01:05:06
<transcript>: Uses Nano ID.

01:05:11
<transcript>: So space is kind of like.

01:05:15
<transcript>: I guess for each game session, we'll have a space.

01:05:15
<transcript>: right

01:05:16
<transcript>: Right.

01:05:21
<transcript>: So let's look at that list list ID page.

01:05:33
<transcript>: So this is going to do something with that ID. So these are all going to be serverside rendered. That's kind of a bummer. Maybe we could use the new Edge serverside rendering to see if that's faster.

01:05:33
<transcript>: wonder if

01:05:35
<transcript>: Wonder if I guess.

01:05:35
<transcript>: i guess

01:05:35
madlep: aws guess bonus round - given a proposal for a new service, estimate the monthly AWS cost to the nearest $100k MaxLOL

01:05:39
<transcript>: I guess replicas is probably not globally distributed. Maybe it is. I don't know.

01:05:47
<transcript>: I just know you all are kind of like over there in Europe. I'm over here in the US. And if we're playing against each other, I don't know. How bad is it gonna be.

01:05:47
<transcript>: how

01:05:49
<transcript>: How slow is it gonna be for somebody.

01:05:59
<transcript>: It'll be a guess bonus round given a purse given a proposal for a new service estimate the monthly A Tobis cost to the nearest 100K.

01:05:59
<transcript>: so many

01:06:03
<transcript>: So many Ath billing jokes. I'm here for it's. Funny.

01:06:07
<transcript>: So we get the list ID.

01:06:12
<transcript>: I'm sure the selected space exists. It's common during development for developers to delete the backend database.

01:06:18
<transcript>: As convenient as we automatically pick a new one when this occurs by redirecting back to the root.

01:06:23
<transcript>: So if the okay so if the space doesn't exist, I see.

01:06:27
<transcript>: Is space exists from their backend yet. Okay.

01:06:36
<transcript>: But otherwise we just provide the list idea. And then here we use replicas with the name.

01:06:42
<transcript>: And mutators. Okay, what are mutaters? So source. Mutators.

01:06:42
<transcript>: let's check this out

01:06:43
<transcript>: Let's check this out.

01:06:52
<transcript>: Right. Turns out. Okay. So these are the things. These are the mutations.

01:06:52
<transcript>: for the real

01:06:55
<transcript>: For the real time stuff.

01:06:59
<transcript>: Validate the incoming data is in fact it's to do update.

01:07:01
<transcript>: With TX.

01:07:04
<transcript>: Tx? Tx.

01:07:04
<transcript>: is

01:07:13
<transcript>: Is right transaction. So this is the signature for these things. The mutators you get a right transaction and to do update.

01:07:15
<transcript>: Okay.

01:07:22
<transcript>: Or no. They're each get their own params. Here.

01:07:26
<transcript>: Okay. I'm just getting my head around this. So.

01:07:29
<transcript>: To do.

01:07:31
<transcript>: There's just a do type.

01:07:36
<transcript>: A read transaction to do update's partial to do and pick to do ID.

01:07:42
<transcript>: Okay, so ID is the only required one. That's what they're doing here.

01:07:42
<transcript>: and then we have a

01:07:47
<transcript>: And then we have a list to Dos, which takes a read transaction and does a.

01:07:47
<transcript>: scan

01:07:57
<transcript>: Scan values to array. Okay, so I guess space is sort of centered around one type of entity. Is that what I'm gathering.

01:08:03
<transcript>: Or maybe you could have any number of arbitrary entities.

01:08:03
<transcript>: but

01:08:07
<transcript>: But these are your mutators so you can update it to do.

01:08:15
<transcript>: Based on the ID as to do next is previous.

01:08:18
<transcript>: So they're spreading previous and.

01:08:18
<transcript>: the

01:08:22
<transcript>: The update? Do I understand what that means? To do update.

01:08:22
<transcript>: so this is the process

01:08:24
<transcript>: So this is the process.

01:08:27
<transcript>: Take the previous one.

01:08:27
<transcript>: upd

01:08:32
<transcript>: Update it with whatever update came in which was a partial so this could be optional.

01:08:32
<transcript>: the id

01:08:41
<transcript>: The ID was the only known thing, and then we do transaction put ID next. Okay, so just updating the state. It's like.

01:08:41
<transcript>: having

01:08:43
<transcript>: Having this distributed.

01:08:43
<transcript>: or

01:08:45
<transcript>: Or like.

01:08:45
<transcript>: rumor

01:08:47
<transcript>: Rumor remote.

01:08:51
<transcript>: Reducer sort of that multiple people can.

01:08:51
<transcript>: multiple

01:08:54
<transcript>: Multiple clients can update.

01:08:54
<transcript>: right

01:08:55
<transcript>: Right.

01:09:02
<transcript>: Or like a remote use state. Even it's just like.

01:09:02
<transcript>: here's a piece

01:09:03
<transcript>: Here's a piece of state.

01:09:03
<transcript>: in this case

01:09:11
<transcript>: In this case it's like an array or a map where there's these IDs, and then the Todo's are inside that.

01:09:11
<transcript>: and we're just updating

01:09:15
<transcript>: And we're just updating it based on the ID. Okay, so then delete.

01:09:19
<transcript>: This transaction delete. Id.

01:09:19
<transcript>: it's like

01:09:22
<transcript>: It's like, okay, it's just a key value store. I'm figuring it out.

01:09:30
<transcript>: Create to do this meter creates a new to do a sign the next available sort value.

01:09:37
<transcript>: Because it's got to figure out, like, here Where's our.

01:09:37
<transcript>: kind of

01:09:42
<transcript>: Kind of laggy, Uhoh, is it kind of laggy? One needs to be done. Figure out.

01:09:42
<transcript>: if

01:09:44
<transcript>: If this thing is good.

01:09:55
<transcript>: How quickly, how quickly do we see these changes? I have no way of knowing. I guess. Well, I could just open this in another browser or something.

01:09:58
<transcript>: Open it over here.

01:09:58
<transcript>: i can see

01:10:01
<transcript>: I can see just how lagging it is.

01:10:07
<transcript>: There it is.

01:10:12
<transcript>: How about now.

01:10:20
stroopwafel26: buy a second mac studio to test the latency

01:10:24
<transcript>: That's pretty fast on my end, but I'm also on the same machine in the US here so that could make sense. Check it off. Kind of laggy. Check that one.

01:10:28
<transcript>: How quickly do we see changes? Yeah. Okay.

01:10:34
<transcript>: Thanks for the Follow Andre Prado.

01:10:38
<transcript>: Buy a second Mac studio to test the latency.

01:10:39
<transcript>: That's funny.

01:10:50
<transcript>: Okay, delete and then create so we await list to dos. We sort them. We get the Max sort. Okay. And then we put.

01:10:53
<transcript>: With the next index maxwart plus one.

01:10:53
<transcript>: that all makes

01:10:55
<transcript>: That all makes sense.

01:10:55
<transcript>: makes sense

01:10:56
<transcript>: Makes sense.

01:11:02
<transcript>: So then when you have these mutators export type M type of mutators.

01:11:04
<transcript>: Then over here.

01:11:07
<transcript>: Let's go back to.

01:11:10
<transcript>: Where? It's right here. I'm gonna give a Lara bar.

01:11:10
<transcript>: i'm very hungry

01:11:12
<transcript>: I'm very hungry.

01:11:23
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:11:34
<transcript>: So we're dotted right here. So we import mutators and then use replicas name and mutators. So then wrap we pass to the app.

01:11:34
<transcript>: the

01:11:39
<transcript>: The app is right here. Yeah.

01:11:39
<transcript>: it gets

01:11:42
<transcript>: It gets past a replica replicach. M.

01:11:44
<transcript>: Right.

01:12:09
<transcript>: Okay.

01:12:13
<transcript>: I guess the strongly type no.

01:12:18
<transcript>: Is it not.

01:12:21
<transcript>: Mutators.

01:12:28
<transcript>: So that creates to do this has is any but.

01:12:30
<transcript>: This also might just be.

01:12:34
<transcript>: I don't know the GitHub.

01:12:40
<transcript>: Online vs. Code thing. Maybe that's the issue.

01:12:46
<transcript>: Does seem like types are working though.

01:12:50
<transcript>: Well, we'll see.

01:12:50
<transcript>: okay

01:12:51
<transcript>: Okay.

01:12:51
<transcript>: so

01:12:55
<transcript>: So I do like replicas. I think this is our answer.

01:13:00
<transcript>: It's a bummer to me if we have to have a.

01:13:07
<transcript>: We have to have a render.

01:13:11
<transcript>: Server running that's kind of a bummer.

01:13:14
<transcript>: Do we, though.

01:13:25
<transcript>: Replicas anything is request we delegate all set request to replicas and actually has was influenced server side of our protocol.

01:13:31
<transcript>: Yeah. So you pass in mutators on the back end as well. This is cool.

01:13:31
<transcript>: where does

01:13:33
<transcript>: Where does where does render come in.

01:13:33
<transcript>: like

01:13:36
<transcript>: Like Why is this set to be deployed.

01:13:37
<transcript>: On render.

01:13:43
<transcript>: Anyone know.

01:13:47
<transcript>: Database, URL.

01:14:03
laytanl_: maybe that is just what they preffer

01:14:03
<transcript>: So I have to provide a database to replicas which makes sense.

01:14:10
<transcript>: So don't know why we need to render though. Maybe that is just what they prefer. Maybe maybe it's not required.

01:14:10
<transcript>: do they have anything about the

01:14:12
<transcript>: Do they have anything about the deployment here.

01:14:14
laytanl_: how do you spell preffer

01:14:16
<transcript>: Frequently imprison performance reference.

01:14:18
<transcript>: How to.

01:14:18
<transcript>: launch

01:14:20
<transcript>: Launch a production.

01:14:33
stroopwafel26: pre-fur

01:14:34
<transcript>: Integrate with your own back end. Let's see.

01:14:38
laytanl_: *Prefer

01:14:49
<transcript>: Render UI.

01:14:56
<transcript>: View remote database.

01:15:09
<transcript>: I feel like I missed a more obvious.

01:15:14
<transcript>: Replicas.

01:15:17
<transcript>: Deployment.

01:15:24
<transcript>: Of verselle and superbase.

01:15:24
<transcript>: what about

01:15:30
<transcript>: What about Planet Scale? Like I'm assuming supervisors for the database, right.

01:15:36
<transcript>: Yeah for storage supervisor's real time features you can use replicas poke message.

01:15:41
<transcript>: What about.

01:15:43
<transcript>: Planetscale.

01:16:02
<transcript>: Quick Start apps assign your next Shape app with the Postgres database back in can therefore be deployed just by the Anywhere node app can be deployed. The one slightly tricky bit is the replicas needs the server to send a server to client poke message when something has changed, telling reproduction to pull again.

01:16:02
<transcript>: the deploy

01:16:08
<transcript>: The deploy on render and apply for Cell Twopace demonstrate two possible configurations to be easy to adapt to many providers and situations.

01:16:08
<transcript>: okay

01:16:12
<transcript>: Okay. And it occurs to me they might require a Postgres.

01:16:12
<transcript>: do they require

01:16:21
<transcript>: Do they require that it's Postgres? Because then I guess supervice doesn't work. I mean put plan skill doesn't work. Thanks for the follow Yo Yo.

01:16:26
<transcript>: Yeah if it has to be Postgres.

01:16:29
fragaverage: postgres has the logical replication thing I was asking about earlier

01:16:34
<transcript>: Then I guess we can't. We could try and use Neon. Let's see what the deploy on Versailles on Superbase. Looks like.

01:16:34
<transcript>: what is

01:16:39
<transcript>: What is the Poke message? Just like a WebSocket. What is it.

01:16:39
<transcript>: replica

01:16:42
<transcript>: Replica can pull on a timer.

01:16:45
fragaverage: but in that instance, you probably dont need replicache since supabase has realtime subscriptions

01:16:47
<transcript>: This is really only used in development much more confirmation TLP until.

01:16:47
<transcript>: i hint this

01:16:51
<transcript>: I hint this should pull soon. A pokecard. The poke doesn't get actual data.

01:16:51
<transcript>: mini wast

01:16:56
<transcript>: Mini Waste is in both the Replicas Two starter app does it using supervasses.

01:16:56
<transcript>: new

01:16:58
<transcript>: New or builtin runtime, features.

01:17:03
<transcript>: Or handrolled WebSocket. Okay.

01:17:09
<transcript>: I mean a poke if it's just a message with no body or anything. Sounds like that'd. Be pretty straightforward. Right.

01:17:09
stroopwafel26: From backend requirements: "Some examples of suitable datastores are: MySQL, Postgres, CockroachDB, CosmosDB, DynamoDB, and Firebase Cloud Firestore (but not Realtime Database)."

01:17:39
<transcript>: Okay.

01:17:47
<transcript>: Welcome, said Poly.

01:17:47
<transcript>: welcome

01:17:50
<transcript>: Welcome. I gotta do the Ham.

01:17:53
<transcript>: This still work. Yeah.

01:17:58
<transcript>: Welcome, welcome, welcome we are building AW, guess.

01:18:03
<transcript>: Which if you've not heard been on previous dream.

01:18:06
<transcript>: See Me a guessing game where you see a.

01:18:10
zikkx: HeyGuys

01:18:10
<transcript>: Service icon for AWS. There's like 300 services.

01:18:10
<transcript>: you see

01:18:15
<transcript>: You see a service icon and you have to guess which service it is. You have, like four options.

01:18:22
<transcript>: Multiple choice, and it's going to be multiplayer. So we're using replicas to build the multilayer part. We're just kind of learning what that looks like.

01:18:26
<transcript>: So I think.

01:18:33
<transcript>: Pope is optional. It's just like a this makes it faster, right? Because it does pull by default.

01:18:47
<transcript>: So we need to we need to have a Postgres database.

01:18:54
<transcript>: Bummer. I mean I'd rather use Postgres, but Bummer, that Planet Scale is my sequel.

01:19:02
<transcript>: Okay. Well.

01:19:15
<transcript>: I need to go ahead and take a break. I'm gonna make my dandy blend. I know. We just kind of got started hour and 20 in. I started kind of late today. Zick, thanks for the follow.

01:19:15
<transcript>: also

01:19:18
cedpoilly: hello 👋

01:19:27
<transcript>: Also welcome to Chat. I'm sorry that you showed up and I'm and you popped into chat even to wave and I'm leaving, but I'll be back very shortly. I'm just gonna make some.

01:19:27
<transcript>: it's like

01:19:30
<transcript>: It's like P. Fake Coffee. It's called Danny blend.

01:19:40
<transcript>: Yeah. And I'll be right back. We're gonna start implementing stuff. I think I've read too much. I think at this point, I've read enough, you know? So I'm start building.

01:19:40
<transcript>: hello said

01:19:47
<transcript>: Hello? Said Polly. We will be back. I'll be back. You all can stay there. But I'll be back shortly.

01:32:21
<transcript>: So I've just got to figure out where I'm gonna put you. I think I'm gonna put you over here.

01:32:27
<transcript>: Got a second little monitor I put up here. Now this way I can watch you and try chat at the same time.

01:32:29
<transcript>: So feel good.

01:32:32
<transcript>: Okay.

01:32:36

01:33:02
<transcript>: So.

01:33:04
adamelmore: one sec, bringing a guest on

01:33:13
<transcript>: Just telling chat. Hang on, I've got to figure out let's see my OBS when I go over.

01:33:13
<transcript>: there

01:33:14
<transcript>: There.

01:33:14
<transcript>: i've got

01:33:19

01:33:23
<transcript>: Camera with guests.

01:33:25
<transcript>: Preview. And then that.

01:33:28
<transcript>: Sorry. One SEC.

01:33:28
<transcript>: camera

01:33:30
<transcript>: Camera.

01:33:33
<transcript>: I want to automate all this. Eventually.

01:33:35
<transcript>: So it's easier.

01:33:41
<transcript>: This is kind of a pain right now. Okay, I gotta get your Ping ID.

01:33:45
<transcript>: Copy embedded link.

01:33:45
<transcript>: yeah

01:33:48
<transcript>: Yeah, Yeah.

01:33:51

01:34:47
<transcript>: And we have a lot of.

01:34:47
<transcript>: people

01:34:52
<transcript>: People complaining about the music. Step Pro famously hates the music on my break.

01:34:52
<transcript>: and i think

01:34:55
<transcript>: And I think of them every time I take a break.

01:34:59
<transcript>: So we've got DAX. I'm gonna bring Daxon. You ready for this.

01:35:03
<transcript>: Guest overlay thing I'm gonna do like this. Please work.

01:35:03
<transcript>: to work

01:35:06
<transcript>: To work oh Oh.

01:35:07
<transcript>: Kind of.

01:35:12
schrew: cant believe you booked dax shepard LUL

01:35:14
<transcript>: Hang on.

01:35:19
<transcript>: Filters. Why is there Chroma key on me right now? That's not good.

01:35:21
<transcript>: What.

01:35:21
<transcript>: i

01:35:23
<transcript>: I look back Shepherd.

01:35:28
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:35:28
<transcript>: how about

01:35:34
<transcript>: How about now? That's weird. I don't know why there's a chromacy on that one. Yeah, not next. Shepherd. Sorry. Daxrad.

01:35:34
<transcript>: dax

01:35:46
<transcript>: Dax, if you don't know who DAX is, Zach's is one of the well, is it just the three of you? Sst back to ya. So he's one of the three folks that make up serverless stack.

01:35:46
<transcript>: serverless

01:35:50
<transcript>: Serverless stack is like built on top of the CDK it's infrastructure as code.

01:35:50
<transcript>: for aws

01:35:52
<transcript>: For AWS.

01:35:52
<transcript>: only i think

01:35:57
<transcript>: Only I think AWS, right? I only care about AWS. So I hope it's it okay. Yeah.

01:36:00
thechosenone1080: audio

01:36:10
<transcript>: But DAX is just really good at everything. So he's like, I don't know. He uses Arch Linux. Is it Arc or Arch Stacks? Which do I say.

01:36:10
delvoid: we cannot hear dax

01:36:13
th3_l3m0n: we cant hear him

01:36:14
stroopwafel26: on mute, or audio really low?

01:36:17
cowfacedude99: we can't hear him @adamelmore

01:36:19
<transcript>: Yeah. Oh, you can't hear. Oh, hang on. They can't hear you. Dax, I'm so sorry. 1 second.

01:36:19
<transcript>: no

01:36:21
<transcript>: No, that's my fault.

01:36:21
<transcript>: this is so

01:36:25
<transcript>: This is so Jank camera guest. There's the audio.

01:36:30
<transcript>: Oh, maybe I need to.

01:36:30
<transcript>: oh i didn't

01:36:33
<transcript>: Oh, I didn't include audio Oops, hang on.

01:36:33
<transcript>: copy

01:36:38
<transcript>: Copy embed link. I need to do this a different way. Settings.

01:36:47
<transcript>: And device settings. You think I'd be good at this? This is all I do. All I do is stream on Twitch anymore. You think I'd have figured it out.

01:36:47
<transcript>: audio

01:36:50
<transcript>: Audio Now I thought I want.

01:36:59
<transcript>: Dax is a Streamr as well. Don't leave. No, I don't want to leave the site. How do I do this? I thought there's a way in paying.

01:36:59
<transcript>: participants

01:37:00
<transcript>: Participants.

01:37:02
<transcript>: Oh, here we go.

01:37:02
<transcript>: particip

01:37:04
<transcript>: Participants.

01:37:04
<transcript>: there's

01:37:05
acorn1010: &audio=on (if using ping) to the URL

01:37:06
<transcript>: There's like a flag. I have to do.

01:37:10
<transcript>: Hey, hang on, wait for it.

01:37:15
<transcript>: Somewhere.

01:37:17
<transcript>: If I was settings.

01:37:22
<transcript>: Maybe I can guess the flag. Let's see if I can guess it.

01:37:25
<transcript>: Camera.

01:37:29
<transcript>: Say and audio true.

01:37:32
<transcript>: Does that sound.

01:37:32
<transcript>: reasonable

01:37:33
<transcript>: Reasonable.

01:37:37
<transcript>: Trying.

01:37:37
<transcript>: next

01:37:38
<transcript>: Next.

01:37:41
<transcript>: Yes, it's a Ping thing.

01:37:46
<transcript>: Audio equals on if using Ping. Thank you. Acorn. Acorns. Here.

01:37:50
<transcript>: Corn saves the day? Hang on one SEC.

01:37:55
acorn1010: Howdy :D

01:37:59
<transcript>: Audio on not true but on I love how many things in Ping are like preview mode.

01:37:59
<transcript>: or like there's no

01:38:06
<transcript>: Or like there's no documentation. It's just like you can do cool things. If you talk to Theo, tells you the cool things you can do.

01:38:09
<transcript>: Exactly.

01:38:09
<transcript>: yeah

01:38:12
schrew: I can hear him now!

01:38:12
<transcript>: Yeah, we can hear you now. Right back. Everybody can hear you.

01:38:19
yozd82: yup

01:38:19
<transcript>: I think you can hear Nashville, that's all I care as long as tricking here and Acorn.

01:38:25
<transcript>: Alright. So DAX, DAX, DAX is here. We're going to.

01:38:36
<transcript>: We're gonna talk a little bit about me, of him. I want him to, like, ultimately, watch over my shoulder as it's been a few weeks. If you remember, DAX was on a few weeks ago.

01:38:36
<transcript>: and

01:38:38
<transcript>: And gave me my first.

01:38:38
<transcript>: like

01:38:42
<transcript>: Like baptism by fire with neovim.

01:38:53
<transcript>: Kind of taught me how to set it up initially and all that. And now I want him to see a few weeks later. Like, how am I doing? What are the main things? Like, if you just did this, you'd save yourself minutes every day.

01:38:55
cowfacedude99: wasn't he the guy who set nvim up for you?

01:38:59
<transcript>: Oh, Geez no, no.

01:39:20
<transcript>: It's not. It's really not. We so right after you came on Decks, you came on, like, a Friday on Monday. I think I was using Lunar Vinervim, and then on Tuesday, I was back to Neovem. It was sort of like, Jenkin all around, but we figured it out. We figured out a setup that I think I really like it. So I don't think it's gonna be that exotic.

01:39:20
<transcript>: it's probably

01:39:23
<transcript>: It's probably it's like Dracula, that's basically it. Everything else is normal.

01:39:24
caldotjs: damn his beard is clean :>

01:39:36
<transcript>: Yes cow face. He was the guy that set up Neohim for me. Thank you for the follows. Peter, I missed these Peter and chosen and Stickle me pickle. I just gotta say that whole name because that's too funny. Kiw meat.

01:39:36
<transcript>: also

01:39:50
<transcript>: Also in Zik. I think I saw sick before I took my break. So we took a you're getting comments? Compliments on your beard, DAX, I've never gotten one compliment on my beard. So like you to just revel in that.

01:39:57
<transcript>: 's awesome.

01:40:00
stroopwafel26: adam your beard looks really good

01:40:03
<transcript>: Yeah. So I took the break until DAX. I totally forgot what time DAX was coming up.

01:40:03
<transcript>: and

01:40:07
<transcript>: And thank you so much, Stroop, I got a COMPLIMENTAL if you.

01:40:14
<transcript>: Didn't remember what time DAX is coming on. I took the break. It's the exact right moment to bring backs on. So here we are.

01:40:14
<transcript>: max

01:40:24
<transcript>: Max, I told you. I think I told you we're building. Did I tell you we're building? Aw. Guess I always want to say AWS, guests, but that would be stupid. The whole point is AW. Guess.

01:40:26
<transcript>: And I told you what it was.

01:40:52
<transcript>: Yeah. I don't remember. I think on the podcast because it's audio. We probably did the AWS for Amazon, like, is it does it start with it? This is a logo thing. So you'll see the logo of the service and you have to guess, but it's gonna be multiplayer. So that's the big thing is we're gonna make it like timed and you're like competing against them in real time.

01:40:55
caldotjs: similar story here. facial hair is cooler than a nice haircut anyways! right.. RIGHT?

01:41:02
<transcript>: And we're really doing it just to learn T three stack. I've never played with T three stack. Mostly, I've never played with TRPC, like I've just wanted to do for a long time. So.

01:41:08
<transcript>: There you go. Maybe.

01:41:13
<transcript>: Throw this game at the end just for Frenzy's. Or maybe what you wait for things to load or something.

01:41:21
<transcript>: Facial here is cooler than a nice haircut anyways. I think so. Okay, we're gonna go to my screen. I'm gonna have to manually do a thing.

01:41:23
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:41:25
<transcript>: Screen.

01:41:25
<transcript>: with guests

01:41:26
<transcript>: With guests.

01:41:28
<transcript>: Okay.

01:41:28
<transcript>: close

01:41:33
<transcript>: Close. Oh, there we are. I don't know why. I guess because this is why I had the grade.

01:41:33
<transcript>: yeah

01:41:37
<transcript>: Yeah, that's why I had it. I'm gonna turn it back on.

01:41:46
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. You know, you were is you prefer that is that easier for you? Because that's easy for me.

01:41:52
<transcript>: Yeah. Let's do that. So I just got start the virtual Cam.

01:41:52
<transcript>: what

01:41:55
<transcript>: What am I sending? Output selection. Let's do.

01:41:57

01:58:56
<transcript>: Okay.

01:58:56
<transcript>: we

01:59:00
alan__rice: adamel4DealWithIt

01:59:01
<transcript>: We good I think we're good I can tell by the bars, Megatron.

01:59:01
<transcript>: how

01:59:05
cowfacedude99: back to normal

01:59:05
<transcript>: How Jeez everybody I'm so sorry for.

01:59:09
cedpoilly: dax is in dax mode: double audio experience

01:59:13
log1400: good

01:59:15
<transcript>: Prpc have docs for web sockets. Oh, you could use sockety for web so I push your alternative much cheaper and selfhused.

01:59:23
<transcript>: I mean I probably rather do that than, like pull up.

01:59:23
<transcript>: an api

01:59:29
<transcript>: An API gateway. Like that. Sounds like more work to do something. Homespun on it.

01:59:30
<transcript>: Right.

01:59:37
<transcript>: I do not.

01:59:37
<transcript>: yeah

01:59:38
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:59:46
<transcript>: Oh, this is a polling. Yeah, because I'm trying to build this whole thing today, like in the next 3 hours. So.

01:59:51
<transcript>: Probably just gonna do the polling thing and we'll see how it goes.

01:59:56
<transcript>: If it's super slow, like we can just make the polling time, like every second or something, right.

01:59:59
<transcript>: Sooner I don't know.

02:00:06
<transcript>: What's somebody said there's Docs here on Remote Database. You said you got it. Working with Planet Scale, right.

02:00:15
<transcript>: In.

02:00:15
<transcript>: soup

02:00:17
<transcript>: Soup in the replicas.

02:00:19
<transcript>: Side.

02:00:25
<transcript>: Oh, maybe yeah, yeah, maybe hang on.

02:00:28
<transcript>: Video.

02:00:35
<transcript>: Thought they had. Oh, yeah. Hair. Share screen. Yes, we can do this next. Share screen. One.

02:00:40
<transcript>: Where do you. Where will you see that, though? I was just gonna show up on Ping. Look at that.

02:00:44
<transcript>: Now you just close my dumb face. You don't even need to see me if you can see my screen.

02:01:03
<transcript>: The poles.

02:01:03
<transcript>: what

02:01:04
<transcript>: What do you mean? The polls.

02:01:12
<transcript>: We have done nothing.

02:01:28
<transcript>: Yeah. So I haven't built anything. There's no frontend. There's no anything. We are at the beginning. This is literally like, the TRPC or Sorry, the T Three starter. And like, I've not even touched any of this.

02:01:28
<transcript>: i've

02:01:32
<transcript>: I've added some images to an image's directory. That's where we're at.

02:01:40
<transcript>: I add a game, Righter? Sorry I was gonna work on some stuff in here for game stuff.

02:01:58
<transcript>: Dynamic pull. Okay.

02:02:24
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:03:09
<transcript>: Of that. And I can just do this in, like, an API route. Yeah.

02:03:16
<transcript>: Okay.

02:03:21
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:03:25
<transcript>: Oh Yeah.

02:03:29
log1400: what happens if there are conflicts with data in remote and local?

02:04:12
<transcript>: Okay.

02:04:12
<transcript>: so this

02:04:17
<transcript>: So this happens on every poll. It's a pool. Every time it pulls. That what you're saying.

02:04:17
<transcript>: yeah

02:04:19
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:04:33
<transcript>: Okay.

02:04:40
<transcript>: Yeah, for the changes.

02:04:52
<transcript>: So question I saw that there was like a billion. There's a default replicas server and you could just have one Apr out that points that does that not work if I'm gonna use my sequel is that the idea.

02:04:56
<transcript>: You know I'm talking about.

02:04:56
<transcript>: yeah like

02:05:00
<transcript>: Yeah. Like, Where is this? That's a Yank? No. Here.

02:05:00
<transcript>: no

02:05:02
<transcript>: No.

02:05:06
<transcript>: Really.

02:05:10
<transcript>: Okay.

02:05:14
<transcript>: So this is what I was referring to. It's. This.

02:05:14
<transcript>: replicas

02:05:18
<transcript>: Replicas. They just have a dynamic route here. And it just says, Handle, request.

02:05:25
<transcript>: But then I work if my database isn't Postgres is my question I guess.

02:05:31
<transcript>: This replication XJS Lib backend.

02:05:35
<transcript>: We could look. I mean, we could pull up the code, I guess.

02:05:45
<transcript>: Yeah, I think is that the render file. This has our database URL.

02:05:48
<transcript>: So they're deploying on render.

02:05:52
veidar45: Hi guys, what is the t3 stack?

02:05:56
<transcript>: But why? What are they deploying on Render? I don't understand that because it seems like it's all happening in the API route.

02:06:06
<transcript>: Oh, Nick, Jess, into render that's interesting. Okay.

02:06:16
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't know. So there. Oh, they're doing their database, like running on Render instead of plant scale. They're using Render as their database. Okay.

02:06:16
<transcript>: that makes

02:06:18
<transcript>: That makes sense.

02:06:20
<transcript>: Maybe.

02:06:20
<transcript>: does that make

02:06:22
<transcript>: Does that make sense.

02:06:30
<transcript>: I don't know. It all feels magical. Like, where does you or I'll get it? Well, I guess that built in server. Let's look at the code. Can we do that.

02:06:30
<transcript>: it's an open source

02:06:31
<transcript>: It's an open source.

02:06:33
log1400: @veidar45 It is a template project to start an app with technologies like tailwind, trpc, typescript , nextauth

02:06:38
<transcript>: Some of it.

02:06:38
<transcript>: rossi

02:06:43
<transcript>: Rossi Corp. Replicas. So I want to look at the next JS.

02:06:43
<transcript>: specific

02:06:45
<transcript>: Specifically.

02:06:47
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:06:52
<transcript>: We think we're on Pace. I'm gonna get this done. Everybody.

02:06:58
<transcript>: Still like ever written a single line of code replicas. There's a server.

02:06:58
<transcript>: what was it

02:06:59
<transcript>: What was it.

02:07:02
<transcript>: Index. Maybe.

02:07:06
<transcript>: What I wanted to see is this create space.

02:07:13
<transcript>: Any data model.

02:07:15
<transcript>: You're saying like.

02:07:17
<transcript>: Go ahead.

02:07:48
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:07:55
<transcript>: So.

02:08:03
<transcript>: Okay. So if I do the custom pull. Is that also, like, I didn't get the sense that it was Typed, like I'm on the front end. You weren't working with, like.

02:08:03
<transcript>: type stuff

02:08:07
<transcript>: Type stuff when you're doing a mutations the mutators thing.

02:08:11
<transcript>: Are you.

02:08:17
<transcript>: Maybe push that to Maine. There broken DAX. Let's get some.

02:08:31
<transcript>: Say, do we even need to do any data outside of replicas? Like I was thinking there would be other stuff. Go ahead.

02:08:37
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:08:44
<transcript>: Well, we're.

02:08:48
veidar45: @log1400 got it, thanks!

02:08:50
<transcript>: What about Auth? Like if I want my rep? You said, like if you open it multiple tabs.

02:08:54
<transcript>: I was gonna use next up because it's T three stack, and that's what I use anyway.

02:08:54
<transcript>: so

02:08:56
<transcript>: So.

02:09:06
<transcript>: I thought TRPC. It has the models working with Prisma for, like, Login and stuff. I thought maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm talking about.

02:09:10
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:09:27
<transcript>: Okay. So then when you said Multiple Tabs would be multiple client IDs instead, it'll be one. It would be the token. Basically, like once they're logged in, it's them.

02:09:27
<transcript>: i want to have a leader

02:09:29
<transcript>: I want to have a leaderboard.

02:09:40
<transcript>: Okay.

02:09:44
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay.

02:09:45
<transcript>: A few thoughts.

02:09:45
<transcript>: so if we

02:09:51
<transcript>: So if we have a leaderboard, I think I still need TrpC. There's stuff that I'm doing that's not real time. Like collaborative.

02:09:51
<transcript>: but i

02:09:54
<transcript>: But I just used to your PC for that.

02:10:03
<transcript>: Secondary.

02:10:06
<transcript>: Okay.

02:10:13
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:10:24
<transcript>: So it's really just an awful thing. Like it's giving you kind of like amplify stuff that they tried to do, like.

02:10:26
<transcript>: Okay.

02:11:05
<transcript>: Oh for AW guess Yeah.

02:11:13
<transcript>: Well, I don't want more complicated, so let's take a step back. If I think about this app and everything I've described to you.

02:11:20
<transcript>: What am I going to run into with TrpC where I can't do what I want to do because I do think there's some real time stuff.

02:11:20
<transcript>: that i

02:11:24
<transcript>: That I need here, like two clients.

02:11:24
<transcript>: post

02:11:29
<transcript>: Post Answers The one client needs to be aware that the other client guessed.

02:11:35
<transcript>: There's the moment where I need some kind of push from the server, right. Unless I did PeerToPeer.

02:11:40
<transcript>: Somebody mentioned Pierre JS. The other downstream. This guy uses pure JS.

02:11:44
<transcript>: You know, I'm saying.

02:12:01
<transcript>: Overkill.

02:12:07
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:12:11
<transcript>: So there's to do example.

02:12:11
<transcript>: we've got this

02:12:14
<transcript>: We've got this to do example. And it doesn't seem like.

02:12:14
<transcript>: a lot of

02:12:18
<transcript>: A lot of stuff to implement. Like if this is my API route.

02:12:21
<transcript>: I can somehow figure out how to make the database work.

02:12:27
<transcript>: So neon.

02:12:33
<transcript>: I don't know there's a previous.

02:12:33
<transcript>: no

02:12:35
<transcript>: No.

02:12:40
<transcript>: Interesting.

02:12:45
<transcript>: Thing there's like Gimme your credentials or something. And I can build with neon.

02:12:49
<transcript>: Do we want to do that? I don't know. Do we want to do that.

02:12:52
<transcript>: Let me guess. Gearmo quote. No. Oh, there it is.

02:13:00
<transcript>: You can take any new startup and you can scroll over the web startup. You can scroll down and find them on the investor list and the quote.

02:13:04
<transcript>: On investor.

02:13:08
<transcript>: Love it like let's read more about their investment.

02:13:08
<transcript>: how much on

02:13:10
<transcript>: How much on the bat.

02:13:11
<transcript>: bath

02:13:11
<transcript>: bath oh

02:13:13
<transcript>: Bath. Oh, did I spell it wrong.

02:13:13
<transcript>: didn't

02:13:22
<transcript>: Didn't call him out specifically. Oh, did he not invent? Yeah, sure he did. I just spelled it wrong. Of course. Yeah. I don't know. So. Yeah.

02:13:26
<transcript>: It's that same crew? Are you in this crew deck? Are you.

02:13:26
<transcript>: a shadow member

02:13:28
<transcript>: A Shadow member. Okay.

02:13:28
<transcript>: okay

02:13:30
<transcript>: Okay.

02:13:33
<transcript>: Well.

02:13:33
<transcript>: start your own crew

02:13:38
<transcript>: Start your own crew. I'm for it. I got convinced my wife to let me to Angel Vest, invest.

02:13:41
<transcript>: There you go.

02:14:01
<transcript>: Okay, so we're kind of on the fence here. Any Twitch shatters have an opinion. Do we need replicas? Do we push forward? We could make I mean, it's just like a file, right? If I do want to implement the polling, the request handling, we just have to implement a few different request types and, you know.

02:14:01
<transcript>: make it work

02:14:06
<transcript>: Make it work with our Prisma. That might be good experience for me playing with Prisma. I don't know.

02:14:06
<transcript>: what we

02:14:12
<transcript>: What we think? What are we? Melding? Two things that should not be melded. Trpc and replicas.

02:14:22
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:14:34
laytanl_: I'd say websockets is fine here but I don't do javascript

02:14:36
<transcript>: So lucky for me. You're here. You've gone through all those paintings.

02:14:50
<transcript>: Tell me if my mental model is all wrong. As I read through the docs and kind of like God up to speed here, my understanding is it feels like it's like a remote.

02:14:50
<transcript>: use state

02:14:55
<transcript>: Use state where multiple clients can call set.

02:14:55
<transcript>: and

02:15:01
<transcript>: And it does all the hard work of syncing that. Or maybe it doesn't. Maybe you have to implement that. I don't know.

02:15:01
<transcript>: is that

02:15:02
<transcript>: Is that way off.

02:15:16
<transcript>: Okay.

02:15:19
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:15:46
<transcript>: That's the rub.

02:15:46
<transcript>: yeah

02:15:48
<transcript>: Yeah, so.

02:16:02
<transcript>: Your PC in Austin. All that? Yeah.

02:16:15
<transcript>: So the bummer there is the whole point of this exercise was for me to, like, explore T three. Yeah. Trpc.

02:16:23
<transcript>: Thanks for follow Google, man. Okay, let's do something really stupid.

02:16:23
<transcript>: yep

02:16:24
<transcript>: Yep.

02:16:28
<transcript>: Okay like client.

02:16:28
<transcript>: to front

02:16:34
<transcript>: To front. You mean like a polling outside of replicas. You're not talking about pulling in replicas.

02:16:41
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:16:57
<transcript>: All right. So you're saying do build the game with just using a polling model into your PC where the clients are just polling to get the current state. Like has the other person guessed that kind of thing.

02:16:59
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:17:13
<transcript>: Okay. I like it. Yeah, because we could. And we could forgot the WebSocket thing later. Okay. So we try and build this whole thing with the RPC and forget replicas is what I'm hearing. Okay. And then we'll see if we can if we run into.

02:17:17
<transcript>: Okay. Yeah.

02:17:20
<transcript>: This isn't a real app so.

02:17:20
<transcript>: it's often

02:17:31
<transcript>: It's often funny to be somebody pointed out that we're building an AWS guest game. Aw gets and there's got me being a best in the well, there is just underneath layers of SAS abstractions.

02:17:34
fragaverage: you're welcome LUL

02:17:45
<transcript>: Exactly. It's always there. Okay, so then I need to just build some stuff. Let's just stop, man. I just got it. I'm so bad. When I'm in the theoretical. I just like, if I'm talking for too long, I just realized, like, I did that to you.

02:17:47
<transcript>: So you said.

02:17:48
<transcript>: Yes.

02:17:55
cowfacedude99: or you can add things later.

02:17:59
<transcript>: Okay. So we're in this thing. What is all this? This pooper app. So now I can see a thing, and I can change the thing. So let's see. Neilvim.

02:17:59
<transcript>: or just vim

02:18:06
<transcript>: Or just vim in general. I know how to delete things. Let's see delete in how do I want to delete in a thing, though, in this.

02:18:06
<transcript>: tag

02:18:07
<transcript>: Tag.

02:18:08
neochromer: Yo Yo

02:18:10
<transcript>: Nope.

02:18:13
<transcript>: Yes.

02:18:13
<transcript>: they don't work

02:18:15
<transcript>: They don't work very well.

02:18:15
<transcript>: for me

02:18:16
<transcript>: For me.

02:18:21
<transcript>: Oh, okay. How do I.

02:18:21
<transcript>: do

02:18:22
neochromer: I still have to understand what TRPC does

02:18:23
<transcript>: Do that.

02:18:29
<transcript>: Because I'm using. Well, what am I using.

02:18:33
<transcript>: Is it there? But I don't know. Let's open a new.

02:18:38
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:18:40
<transcript>: Okay.

02:18:51
<transcript>: Fold. So I'm using tree sitter for folding. Yeah.

02:18:56
cowfacedude99: You had treesitter folds. @adamelmore

02:19:00
thdxr: vim.o.foldlevel = 99 vim.o.foldmethod = "indent" vim.o.foldenable = true

02:19:01
<transcript>: Twitch chat. Maybe. I know.

02:19:04
<transcript>: Yeah, my tree center holds do not work that well.

02:19:08
<transcript>: Fold in a Bowl.

02:19:12
<transcript>: Sorry, inside joke.

02:19:15
<transcript>: Oh, I have it. All right. Here, look at this.

02:19:15
fragaverage: @NeoChromer at the basic level (from my own understanding) its type script api routes

02:19:19
<transcript>: I mean I have parts of it fold method.

02:19:25
<transcript>: And then okay. And then expression.

02:19:25
<transcript>: so i'm using

02:19:28
<transcript>: So I'm using tree sitter here, you know.

02:19:28
<transcript>: i know

02:19:32
<transcript>: I know it's git, and I know, like I could just, I don't know.

02:19:34
<transcript>: Oh, I could just.

02:19:34
<transcript>: look

02:19:39
<transcript>: Look at my gethead history, but I want to keep that right there. Just in case.

02:19:39
<transcript>: because i want to back out

02:19:42
<transcript>: Because I want to back out immediately. Okay.

02:19:45
<transcript>: So fold? Oh, Yeah.

02:19:45
<transcript>: okay

02:19:46
<transcript>: Okay.

02:19:54
<transcript>: Now I was right. Yeah.

02:20:01
<transcript>: So full level nine fold method in dense foldenable is true.

02:20:03
<transcript>: I totally call that one.

02:20:09
<transcript>: Are these O's Oops? Are these O's for options.

02:20:18
<transcript>: Okay. Now you're good. It's opt. Yes. After it's just. I use opt everywhere else.

02:20:22
<transcript>: I want to do that.

02:20:24
<transcript>: Okay.

02:20:24
<transcript>: folding

02:20:26
laytanl_: I think opt is better

02:20:29
<transcript>: Folding Bolt. Yeah, yeah, well, I don't know. I used. Oh, before as well.

02:20:33
<transcript>: Zim? Ooh different than VM? Op cafes. I need you.

02:20:33
<transcript>: cafe sign

02:20:34
laytanl_: That's what TJ said

02:20:35
<transcript>: Cafe signal.

02:20:43
<transcript>: At the basic level from my own understanding, it's TypeScript API wraps oh, somebody's estimates on mouse oh, trpca.

02:20:47
<transcript>: I think opt is better. That's what TJ says. Well, I'm going to teach this.

02:20:49
<transcript>: Teaches my hero.

02:20:49
<transcript>: index

02:20:52
<transcript>: Index. They're both my hairs. Okay, so save this.

02:20:57
<transcript>: Source it now. If I fold, go ahead.

02:21:04
cowfacedude99: I personally prefer opts

02:21:05
<transcript>: And then I don't remember what my I think Vo was my unfold.

02:21:08
<transcript>: I don't know why.

02:21:08
<transcript>: where i got

02:21:09
<transcript>: Where I got those.

02:21:12
<transcript>: Oh really.

02:21:12
<transcript>: so if i

02:21:14
<transcript>: So if I let me go.

02:21:14
<transcript>: okay

02:21:16
<transcript>: Okay, let me.

02:21:17
<transcript>: Go.

02:21:17
laytanl_: I believe opt tells you when you make a typo and o doesn't

02:21:28
<transcript>: What did I do? I'm trying to also learn tmux. I think I told you that. Okay. So I'm in here. I'm gonna quit this reinvent.

02:21:28
<transcript>: okay what

02:21:33
<transcript>: Okay. What? Was I in server? No. Was I in index? I don't know.

02:21:42
<transcript>: So main it's on a fold. This zero. Oh, that was way better than the three sitter ones.

02:21:50
<transcript>: Yeah. No, that's nice.

02:21:50
<transcript>: i

02:21:51
<transcript>: I.

02:21:58
<transcript>: Okay. I definitely learned some of the things about like if I want to select everything inside.

02:21:58
<transcript>: like how would i

02:22:01
<transcript>: Like how would I even just like not.

02:22:06
<transcript>: Select everything inside this main tag. Do I have to use the invent surround for that kind of stuff.

02:22:08
<transcript>: Even though.

02:22:12
<transcript>: Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. Let me just delete.

02:22:15
<transcript>: It's interesting.

02:22:15
<transcript>: i

02:22:17
<transcript>: I.

02:22:17
<transcript>: 'm gonna just do

02:22:18
<transcript>: 'm Gonna Just do.

02:22:20
<transcript>: Redo.

02:22:30
<transcript>: I keep trying to undo my fold. That's done. Can't do that. But I can do that. So it's not folding, like, quite like I expect so. If I zero this.

02:22:32
<transcript>: What did I do? Zc.

02:22:32
<transcript>: did you see

02:22:34
<transcript>: Did you see that it's holding everything.

02:22:34
<transcript>: everything in

02:22:38
<transcript>: Everything in the main, which is better than what I had but.

02:22:40
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:22:40
<transcript>: see that

02:22:41
<transcript>: See that.

02:22:46
<transcript>: Create? Yeah.

02:22:46
<transcript>: for the first

02:22:48
<transcript>: For the first character.

02:22:55
<transcript>: Za does nothing for me but ZC toggles all of it.

02:23:07
cowfacedude99: mostly because p and h1 is on the same level I guess

02:23:07
<transcript>: I would just fold this tag, but I think if I wanted to delete this tag, I would do like DP no current buffer than not in this mode.

02:23:11
<transcript>: Would I just delete this tag? Someone tell me how I do that.

02:23:14
<transcript>: Personally prefer Ops.

02:23:18
<transcript>: Make a type of oh doesn't. Okay. Mostly it's P and H one is on the same level, I guess.

02:23:18
<transcript>: so all

02:23:31
<transcript>: So all of these are on the same level. So it folds. Like if I did this one, I tried to just fold here. I would say that worked. Okay. That's a good call. Thank you, Josh. With Vol P One XL. Appreciate your follow.

02:23:34
<transcript>: Really.

02:23:34
<transcript>: it could be something else

02:23:37
<transcript>: It could be something else. Conflicting.

02:23:42
fragaverage: is this why the average dev salary is so high? We make the most simplest things look complex af LUL

02:23:45
<transcript>: Someone remind me so if I want to surround this, I think I would do like it's like.

02:23:45
<transcript>: ys

02:23:52
cowfacedude99: try keeping some spacing in h1 and p

02:23:52
laytanl_: I think vim has 'dit' & 'dat' for delete around tag

02:23:53
<transcript>: Yscs? And so y? S would be created a new one. So found a surround. This H one tag. I do like YS.

02:23:53
<transcript>: o

02:23:55
<transcript>: O.

02:23:55
<transcript>: and

02:23:59
<transcript>: And then the tag name is O n.

02:23:59
<transcript>: y

02:24:01
<transcript>: Y? S.

02:24:01
<transcript>: someone

02:24:03
<transcript>: Someone tell me what I do is.

02:24:10
<transcript>: Yeah, it's inventor round. Or maybe it's.

02:24:12
<transcript>: In.

02:24:28
<transcript>: Dent for delete around tag. Okay, so if I want to delete this whole H one, I would do that. Yeah, yeah. That's how I would do it, because that's what I remember. And by remember. I mean, I have late in here to remind me. Thanks for the follow Iro series. Oh.

02:24:34
<transcript>: Try keeping some spacing and H one and T who seems if I have a space between them like this.

02:24:40
<transcript>: If I had this, then I can I might be able to toggle that now.

02:24:42
<transcript>: Big deal.

02:24:46
<transcript>: No, yeah, but I can. Dad. It.

02:24:46
<transcript>: or

02:24:49
<transcript>: Or I can bid it.

02:24:56
<transcript>: Yeah, that's just confusing because it moved my thing up there. Okay, now we're done with in them. I just wanted to. I wanted to play a little bit.

02:25:02
<transcript>: We're not done with MVM. I mean, we're keeping it in forever, but I mean, we're done.

02:25:17
<transcript>: Oh, it's stuck. I'm a huge fan. It's just it's a hobby, you know, like, I get all the arguments for, like, I could have just stuck with VSCO. News zone bindings, and, like, probably saved a ton of time. But this is like one of my favorite hobbies now is like playing around with my indent.

02:25:17
<transcript>: at this point

02:25:21
<transcript>: At this point in my career, I need cool hobbies like that that are fun.

02:25:21
<transcript>: thank you

02:25:25
<transcript>: Thank you, fish for the follow. Sorry, Jack. So I'm just gonna interrupt you all the time with all my Thankies.

02:25:42
<transcript>: Okay, so we have this Hello example. It's getting so what do we need to do when the page loads? I want to go ahead and Baken off, but then I have to build a login page because T three doesn't have like, a builtin login page. It's already style for me, which I thought it would, and I hoped it would, but I'm not blaming them. It's not their fault. They built an amazing thing.

02:25:47
<transcript>: Hey, Yeah.

02:25:47
<transcript>: agreed

02:25:55
fragaverage: use github auth to start, easy easy

02:25:57
<transcript>: Agreed. Agreed. So when you when you hit the page, what we need to do is just start a new game. I guess we're gonna need buttons for, like.

02:25:57
<transcript>: crazy

02:25:58
<transcript>: Crazy.

02:26:00
cowfacedude99: t3 is minimal.

02:26:08
<transcript>: Yeah, because we have to create a room. This will kind of mimic what Replicas did. Basically, like.

02:26:13
<transcript>: A. Rpc. Throws this whole new thing in my brain that I don't know anything about.

02:26:13
<transcript>: but i normally

02:26:18
<transcript>: But I normally just create a route if I want to like when you hit the page.

02:26:21
<transcript>: We like get into game. Is that the idea.

02:26:21
<transcript>: is that we were thinking

02:26:22
<transcript>: Is that we were thinking.

02:26:29
<transcript>: Okay so API. But I feel like I should do that with TRPC or something.

02:26:32
<transcript>: I do that with a TrpC router thing.

02:26:32
<transcript>: kind of learn

02:26:34
<transcript>: Kind of learn T three SEC.

02:26:39
cowfacedude99: theo is very particular about adding things from what I have seen on his vods.

02:26:41
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. You're a solid person.

02:26:42
<transcript>: You solid.

02:26:52
<transcript>: Really? Okay. Well, I mean, I think. Do you use CrPC? I thought you used it for something. Yeah, Yeah.

02:27:01
<transcript>: I guess the way next interpc interact is we just got this API route. It's a dynamic PrPC Apr out, and it does all that stuff.

02:27:01
<transcript>: so

02:27:01
fragaverage: pages/room/[id].tsx

02:27:04
<transcript>: So then we just define our router, right.

02:27:13
<transcript>: So this is where I would do that. I think.

02:27:15
<transcript>: Resolve.

02:27:20
<transcript>: Yeah. So this did have some other stuff in it.

02:27:25
<transcript>: Let's get some of that stuff out. I don't think any of these types matter.

02:27:29
<transcript>: I want to see the examples more than want to see my dumb stuff.

02:27:32
<transcript>: Okay. So here's like go ahead.

02:27:48
<transcript>: Yep.

02:27:55
<transcript>: Create is this gonna be our game router? So I guess the pass will be like game or something.

02:27:58
<transcript>: So what I just say, like.

02:28:02
<transcript>: Okay.

02:28:07
<transcript>: Like the way they're naming them is like this, right.

02:28:12
<transcript>: I'm saying.

02:28:25
<transcript>: The name still needs to define that. Okay. Yeah.

02:28:25
<transcript>: so

02:28:26
<transcript>: So.

02:28:26
<transcript>: game

02:28:31
<transcript>: Game? Would I do it like Dame New? Or would I do like.

02:28:43
<transcript>: Well, I guess I'm trying to figure out like this is gonna be the actual route.

02:28:44
<transcript>: I'm gonna hit.

02:28:44
<transcript>: i'm not hitting

02:28:49
<transcript>: I'm not hitting a route. I don't know. I don't know anything about TRPC. It's so confusing.

02:28:52
fragaverage: won't game get applied anyway

02:28:53
<transcript>: Okay.

02:29:00
fragaverage: so new becomes game.new

02:29:05
<transcript>: So ignore this is not creating like a router and http sense that I'm used to.

02:29:05
<transcript>: okay

02:29:11
<transcript>: Okay. Dissolve. And there's no parameters for this thing. It's just gonna be.

02:29:11
<transcript>: right

02:29:13
<transcript>: Right? I'm just gonna return a thing.

02:29:13
<transcript>: it could be like

02:29:17
<transcript>: It could be like return away. I'll go ahead. What are you thinking.

02:29:24
<transcript>: Okay.

02:29:27
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay.

02:29:29
coil_twitch_bot: Cheer100

02:29:30
<transcript>: Of course not.

02:29:33
<transcript>: Input? Yeah.

02:29:36
<transcript>: Okay.

02:29:36
<transcript>: so in

02:29:38
<transcript>: So input.

02:29:38
<transcript>: i'm gonna

02:29:42
<transcript>: I'm gonna use Odd because why not learn five new things at once.

02:29:44
<transcript>: Zod.

02:29:48
neochromer: @FragAverage what routes? My routes? l9ol

02:29:51
<transcript>: Sorry. What did I do? What did I just do? Oh, my word.

02:29:51
<transcript>: this happened

02:29:52
<transcript>: This happened.

02:29:52
<transcript>: team ox

02:30:01
<transcript>: Team Ox environment. Oh, Geez, I just. Oh, I just did a Pmux commander in the install all my ungies. Okay, we're good.

02:30:04
<transcript>: I was gonna add a.

02:30:08
<transcript>: So then.

02:30:13
<transcript>: Yeah, man. String. Oh, no. Sorry. Z.

02:30:15
<transcript>: String.

02:30:23
<transcript>: Min one like that. Okay.

02:30:25
<transcript>: Now.

02:30:32
<transcript>: Sorry I got in a weird place input.

02:30:34
<transcript>: But don't.

02:30:34
<transcript>: go ahead

02:30:35
<transcript>: Go ahead.

02:30:40
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:30:42
fragaverage: no, not all. Only trpc routers through the trpc router

02:30:52
<transcript>: Input dot name Cool. And that's a string. Okay, cool. Hey, DAX, quick question. Is there a way in TypeScript to say this thing is a string, but it's exactly five characters.

02:30:56
<transcript>: Or any whatever any number of characters.

02:31:00
<transcript>: I thought so Google let me down the other day.

02:31:18
<transcript>: I.

02:31:38
<transcript>: Sound smart to me. I'm smarter than I am. Okay, sorry, that was this little side detour. I just noticed. Switch chat. Thank you so much for the bits coil Twitch bot. I know who that is. It's something at the bot. Thank you so much for cheering. The robot's are cheering. Now.

02:31:38
<transcript>: and it's all

02:31:41
<transcript>: And it's all frag had some comments here.

02:31:41
<transcript>: only

02:31:44
<transcript>: Only TrpC routers through the T RPC router.

02:31:44
<transcript>: only prb

02:31:48
<transcript>: Only PRBC wraps through the TRP router gotcha gotcha okay.

02:31:56
<transcript>: Cool. And yeah. Cafes. I am aware. It's very minimal. I've heard his justification. It makes perfect sense.

02:32:02
<transcript>: I just. I hate making login pages, so I'm bitter. That's all. Okay.

02:32:09
<transcript>: We're not gonna make one, though. We're doing this. So we've got this input name, and then we would do, like a Prisma. We're gonna create.

02:32:09
<transcript>: in

02:32:12
<transcript>: In prison. I've got to go to my scheme, I guess. Right.

02:32:15
<transcript>: Time to do this.

02:32:20
<transcript>: Start editing our Prisma schema.

02:32:23
<transcript>: Right.

02:32:28
<transcript>: Got a bit of stuff for next sauce. Right there. Lucid X.

02:32:28
<transcript>: you're just thinking

02:32:29
<transcript>: You're just thinking. Okay.

02:32:35
<transcript>: Yeah. Just observing. So we're gonna have a model game like this, right.

02:32:47
<transcript>: Just literally my first time doing any of this stuff. I've never used Prisma. I've never used. I mean, I've hardly used SQL databases anymore. It's been a long time. Id.

02:32:47
<transcript>: default

02:32:48
<transcript>: Default.

02:32:51
<transcript>: What's a Cu ID.

02:32:59
<transcript>: Okay. Is it like a Eulid? Okay. So they're cool. They use eulids. And that's what I wanted to know.

02:32:59
<transcript>: so

02:33:02
<transcript>: So game has an idea.

02:33:08
<transcript>: I'm not doing off right now so I don't really want to tie to like users.

02:33:10
<transcript>: Right.

02:33:15
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:33:17
<transcript>: I guess so.

02:33:21
<transcript>: It's not unique. It's not anything, I guess. Right.

02:33:23
<transcript>: Okay.

02:33:28
<transcript>: Oh, the question Mark.

02:33:28
<transcript>: probably we don't

02:33:30
<transcript>: Probably. We don't want it to be no, yeah, Yeah.

02:33:39
<transcript>: Okay. What is it? Format this. I guess it doesn't handle Schema files. Prettier isn't configured to do that? I don't know.

02:33:47
<transcript>: Language server for prison. Other probably is. I said that as a joke, but they're probably it.

02:33:47
<transcript>: okay

02:33:47
daeeyy: cit is pretty cool for inserting into a tag, will try and remember that one.

02:33:48
<transcript>: Okay.

02:33:51
<transcript>: I hate, I hate this.

02:33:51
<transcript>: my teaser

02:34:02
<transcript>: My teaser today for this twist dream is about how someday I want streams. Someday I won't be at computers. Someday I won't do anything at a computer. And some days I look forward to that. Okay. So if I if I did this.

02:34:09
<transcript>: Oh, I don't know. You tell me my first time using Prisma. Is there.

02:34:20
<transcript>: Okay, well, let's do that code in Step. Who knows it.

02:34:24
daeeyy: and you can do recursive type defs for strings of specific length, seems cursed tho

02:34:28
<transcript>: 's there's prisons studio but that was like a to see your models and stuff

02:34:29
<transcript>: Where was that.

02:34:31
<transcript>: I'm gonna leak something.

02:34:31
<transcript>: it's confirmed

02:34:34
kamelpaj: prisma db push i think

02:34:34
<transcript>: It's confirmed. I will. There it is. There's. The.

02:34:34
<transcript>: that's kind of cool

02:34:36
<transcript>: That's kind of cool.

02:34:36
<transcript>: pris

02:34:41
<transcript>: Prisma DV push. Is that all? Yeah. I think I saw that in the MPX.

02:34:41
<transcript>: prisma

02:34:42
<transcript>: Prisma.

02:34:52
fragaverage: and then npx prisma generate, to rebuild the client adapter thingy

02:34:54
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:34:55
<transcript>: Plan of scale.

02:35:00
<transcript>: Yeah, we'll call it a branch. It's main.

02:35:03
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:35:03
<transcript>: so here we

02:35:08
<transcript>: So here we got our game now. Right? Game. Id. Name cool.

02:35:08
<transcript>: we

02:35:09
<transcript>: We did it.

02:35:09
<transcript>: are we done

02:35:11
<transcript>: Are we done.

02:35:16
<transcript>: No, I know. I'm being stupid.

02:35:18
<transcript>: We've done nothing yet.

02:35:18
<transcript>: it's like what two

02:35:21
<transcript>: It's like what, two and a half hours into the stream.

02:35:21
<transcript>: we're still working

02:35:23
<transcript>: We're still working on Hello, world.

02:35:23
<transcript>: prism

02:35:28
<transcript>: Prisma game wait Where's context.

02:35:28
<transcript>: contact

02:35:31
<transcript>: Contact should be in the resolve up here.

02:35:36
<transcript>: Await context.

02:35:36
<transcript>: how do you create

02:35:39
<transcript>: How do you create a new thing in prison? Someone tell me.

02:35:50
<transcript>: Okay. That was what you were getting at. And I just ignored you. And I did what I wanted to do.

02:35:50
<transcript>: impact

02:35:54
<transcript>: Impact Prisma generate this generates like TypeScript stuff.

02:36:00
<transcript>: Wait a minute. Generated. Okay. You think that was it.

02:36:08
<transcript>: I don't know how to go back.

02:36:08
<transcript>: well cuz i'm not

02:36:09
<transcript>: Well, cuz I'm not on that window.

02:36:14
<transcript>: Man.

02:36:14
<transcript>: really

02:36:18
<transcript>: Really have to pee. And I don't. I hate to do that to you.

02:36:25
<transcript>: It didn't. It didn't do it. But maybe I need to, like, reload something. Let's reload the LSP.

02:36:29
<transcript>: Just making stuff up.

02:36:29
<transcript>: is my

02:36:31
kamelpaj: npx prisma generate dev i think =)

02:36:32
<transcript>: Is my game. There it is.

02:36:32
<transcript>: new

02:36:33
<transcript>: New.

02:36:33
<transcript>: what is it

02:36:34
<transcript>: What is it.

02:36:36
<transcript>: Insert.

02:36:38
kamelpaj: oh nvm :p

02:36:39
fragaverage: create

02:36:40
<transcript>: Up Cert. I think I saw up Cert, but I didn't see insert.

02:36:43
<transcript>: I create. Yeah. Okay.

02:36:43
<transcript>: i have

02:36:51
<transcript>: I have to be I'm sorry we're gonna go to break while IP I'll be right back I've got a guest. I won't keep you guys waiting be right back.

02:37:11
fragaverage: thats a weird break screen

02:37:15
laytanl_: lol

02:37:18
fragaverage: Dax 👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼

02:38:00
th3_l3m0n: that is one flashy brb screen

02:38:59
1337cookietv: Its kinda cool. Be nice if i could read the code with a seizure tho

02:39:01
<transcript>: What's going on here.

02:39:01
<transcript>: what

02:39:03
<transcript>: What what is going.

02:39:07
<transcript>: What is going on.

02:39:07
<transcript>: unbreak

02:39:08
<transcript>: Unbreak.

02:39:08
<transcript>: oh yeah

02:39:13
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. You're fine. I'm just trying to figure out what all is broken here.

02:39:18
<transcript>: Okay. This is the last time I use beta software.

02:39:22
<transcript>: Something crashed OBS quit unexpectedly.

02:39:25
<transcript>: Oh, that was earlier.

02:39:25
<transcript>: now

02:39:27
<transcript>: Now it's just broken. Let's see.

02:39:34
<transcript>: Yeah. No. The stream is still going.

02:39:34
<transcript>: the problem

02:39:37
<transcript>: The problem is.

02:39:38
<transcript>: everything

02:39:40
<transcript>: My overlays is broken.

02:39:42
<transcript>: What.

02:39:49
<transcript>: 's Try it again.

02:40:03
<transcript>: Hey, we're here kind of.

02:40:03
<transcript>: oh

02:40:05
<transcript>: Oh.

02:40:05
<transcript>: nope

02:40:07
<transcript>: Nope lost X.

02:40:12
<transcript>: Just like just like a planned it.

02:40:14
<transcript>: Guys like that break.

02:40:15
<transcript>: That was nice.

02:40:19
fragaverage: smoooooth

02:40:26
<transcript>: It's funny. Like today's the last time streaming for like a week. I mean, I'm smooth. Yeah. I won't be back until Wednesday. Next week.

02:40:39
<transcript>: So I'm gonna be, like, out of town. I can't figure all this stuff. I'm just gonna come back Wednesday, and you guys are gonna just have to deal with all this. Jank, I'm sorry. The stream used to be so good. It used to be. And then I broke it.

02:40:42
<transcript>: Okay. Where were we.

02:40:46
<transcript>: So create.

02:40:50
<transcript>: Yeah. And so I have to provide something probably here.

02:40:50
fragaverage: and then nvim happened, lets be honest 👀👀

02:40:53
<transcript>: My invent broken as well.

02:40:58
<transcript>: Okay. Hello, Sisaga. I'm gonna get rid of LSP socket. I regret it.

02:40:58
<transcript>: create

02:41:03
<transcript>: Created path again. I object here. I just can't get like intelligent.

02:41:07
<transcript>: Yeah? Args.

02:41:07
<transcript>: data

02:41:08
<transcript>: Data.

02:41:08
<transcript>: and then

02:41:11
<transcript>: And then the fields of the thing, I guess.

02:41:13
<transcript>: Guys.

02:41:18
<transcript>: And then name.

02:41:21
<transcript>: The input name right.

02:41:23
<transcript>: We did it.

02:41:23
<transcript>: what is this

02:41:26
fragaverage: and then you can do returns: { name }... I think?

02:41:28
<transcript>: What is this file? This is a TypeScript file. I feel like that should have like wrapped.

02:41:31
<transcript>: Dude. And I guess that's fine.

02:41:31
<transcript>: how long

02:41:33
<transcript>: How long it can be.

02:41:40
<transcript>: Okay. Oh. Well, this is this is Invalid JavaScript right here. So that's one thing.

02:41:40
<transcript>: was my

02:41:47
<transcript>: Was my earslint not working? Oh, Geez, I gotta stop with the like, just use stuff as soon as it's possible. If.

02:41:53
<transcript>: I used to have it. Yes. Lent. Working. I promise.

02:41:53
<transcript>: i could

02:42:02
<transcript>: I could do this, and it would tell me you can't do that. Oh, wait. Maybe. Is that yes. Lender TypeScript. So this one's definitely broken. Oh, Geez.

02:42:05
<transcript>: No Chef. Oh.

02:42:05
<transcript>: what

02:42:07
<transcript>: What a time.

02:42:07
fragaverage: LUL

02:42:09
fragaverage: perfect

02:42:10
<transcript>: What a time to to do that.

02:42:12
<transcript>: Perfect.

02:42:12
<transcript>: everything's

02:42:15
thdxr: lol

02:42:16
<transcript>: Everything's out of sorts anyway. Might as well kick me along.

02:42:20
<transcript>: Oh, man. Oh, we lost DAX. I've got to reopen.

02:42:25
<transcript>: This dream is cursed.

02:42:25
<transcript>: i should have just

02:42:26
thdxr: things were already working so well

02:42:29
<transcript>: I should have just gone. I should have just gone away for the weekend already.

02:42:31
<transcript>: I got a reopen Ping.

02:42:35
<transcript>: Oh, Jeez.

02:42:39
laytanl_: NotLikeThis

02:42:40
<transcript>: There you can enjoy that while.

02:42:59
<transcript>: Man. Dax, this is a mess.

02:43:04

treetoptowerz: Damn did you just get Rick rolled??? My son learned how to screen mirror and has been Rick rolling me all month

02:43:07
<transcript>: I mean why did I think I should install macOS.

02:43:07
<transcript>: that

02:43:13
<transcript>: That was really that was tough time. I did just get Rick rolled tree top.

02:43:17
<transcript>: Gotta spin those points. I get it.

02:43:17
<transcript>: okay

02:43:18
<transcript>: Okay.

02:43:18

<transcript>: We're gonna kill this.

02:43:20
<transcript>: geez

02:43:21
<transcript>: Geez.

02:43:27
<transcript>: I don't think I could have been more like this compulbulated anyway.

02:43:27
<transcript>: but

02:43:34
<transcript>: But now I'm really I'm really messed up. So we don't have DAX on here. Screen with guests. There's DAX.

02:43:37
<transcript>: Oh.

02:43:37
<transcript>: this

02:43:39
<transcript>: This is like.

02:43:39
<transcript>: this whole

02:43:41
<transcript>: This whole stream has held together with.

02:43:46
<transcript>: Duct tape at this point let's do topic.

02:43:46
<transcript>: building

02:43:50
<transcript>: Building. Aw, guess with the T three.

02:43:52
adamelmore: !topic building awguess with the t3 stack and dax!

02:43:52
<transcript>: Stack, and DAX.

02:43:55
<transcript>: That we're.

02:43:55
<transcript>: at least

02:44:02
<transcript>: At least there's that we got something going for us. So eslyn's not working. I got a reopened Chrome.

02:44:02
<transcript>: do i still have

02:44:04
<transcript>: Do I still have you, DAX.

02:44:10
<transcript>: I don't hear DAX anymore, either. He's not actually talking.

02:44:13
<transcript>: Or.

02:44:15
<transcript>: Gonna lose him again.

02:44:21
<transcript>: Is anyone here? Am I alone.

02:44:24
<transcript>: I see Daks.

02:44:31
daeeyy: we can hear both you and dax

02:44:40
<transcript>: I don't hear you, Daks, why don't I hear you? Does everyone else hear you? I don't have Ping opened.

02:44:43
daeeyy: but seems like you can't hear each other lol

02:44:43

02:45:03
<transcript>: ping i need to

02:45:05
<transcript>: Ping, I need to worry about it.

02:45:06
fragaverage: somewhere*

02:45:08
<transcript>: Okay.

02:45:10
<transcript>: Don't touch it.

02:45:10
<transcript>: okay

02:45:11
<transcript>: Okay.

02:45:11
<transcript>: got some feed

02:45:13
<transcript>: Got some feedback from somewhere? Yeah, I heard that.

02:45:17
fragaverage: ah its gone

02:45:19
<transcript>: Dax turned up too late. I didn't think this effective Dax's volume. And just in mind. Phones. But.

02:45:20
laytanl_: Tempting to Rick Roll again lol

02:45:21
<transcript>: Who knows.

02:45:24
<transcript>: Who knows? Okay.

02:45:24
<transcript>: we're

02:45:25
laytanl_: But that is mean

02:45:29
<transcript>: We're back tempting to Rick roll again don't do it like don't do it.

02:45:32
<transcript>: You have to disable stuff.

02:45:33
<transcript>: Okay.

02:45:33
<transcript>: real quick

02:45:35
<transcript>: Real quick.

02:45:35
<transcript>: let's go

02:45:38
<transcript>: Let's go over here and see a slant B.

02:45:43
<transcript>: So Eslan is available. There is this a tmux thing.

02:45:45
<transcript>: That I actually.

02:45:45
<transcript>: don't lose

02:45:48
<transcript>: Don't lose my ears lint somehow because of tmux.

02:45:48
<transcript>: would that be any

02:45:54
<transcript>: Would that be any insulin air? Maybe it wouldn't maybe just be a type script there. I feel like that would be a neosaur, but.

02:45:54
<transcript>: import

02:45:57
<transcript>: Import blah from.

02:46:00
<transcript>: Batonia, slinier.

02:46:00
<transcript>: type

02:46:04
<transcript>: Typescript. I don't think this one's working, and that bothers me, but you know what.

02:46:04
<transcript>: we got a lot of

02:46:07
<transcript>: We got a lot of problems right now, and that's not.

02:46:07
<transcript>: the beast

02:46:09
<transcript>: The beastress.

02:46:09
<transcript>: okay

02:46:10
<transcript>: Okay.

02:46:10
<transcript>: so we're creating

02:46:13
<transcript>: So we're creating a new one, right.

02:46:16
<transcript>: Okay, I know what this is.

02:46:23
<transcript>: Game create data input name so now I can go to the front end.

02:46:25
<transcript>: I don't need Chrome open, I guess.

02:46:28
<transcript>: A open crowd.

02:46:31
<transcript>: Localhost.

02:46:41
<transcript>: Days. I'm really ready for vacation, you know, some days you're just really ready to take some time off. This is this is gonna make it real nice.

02:46:41
<transcript>: enjoy

02:46:43
<transcript>: Enjoy that time off immensely.

02:46:48
<transcript>: Okay. So we have a front end now on the front end.

02:46:48
<transcript>: index

02:46:56
<transcript>: Index. I can go over here and we can actually do the same. So use query it's using mutation now. Right.

02:46:56
<transcript>: muta

02:47:00
<transcript>: Mutation. And then I do the name of it.

02:47:02
<transcript>: Which is.

02:47:02
<transcript>: game

02:47:04
<transcript>: Game new.

02:47:12
<transcript>: Extreme last I was never.

02:47:15
<transcript>: Then I use meditation works. Maybe not.

02:47:17
<transcript>: Pass.

02:47:26
<transcript>: It's an array of never.

02:47:33
<transcript>: Oh, I have to type it. I have to type it like this.

02:47:37
<transcript>: No, you don't.

02:47:41
<transcript>: Hear me typing nonsense.

02:47:45
<transcript>: What do I want to do here.

02:47:45
<transcript>: let's

02:47:47
<transcript>: Let's just delete.

02:47:54
<transcript>: That.

02:48:00
<transcript>: This is Never, though.

02:48:05
<transcript>: Oh.

02:48:09
<transcript>: Index I need Oh.

02:48:12
<transcript>: No, it's not.

02:48:14
<transcript>: So merge.

02:48:19
<transcript>: Okay. So I don't need game dot. Yeah.

02:48:19
<transcript>: game

02:48:22
<transcript>: Game router we're gonna import.

02:48:22
<transcript>: up here

02:48:24
<transcript>: Up here.

02:48:32
<transcript>: To write more code. I think that's my problem. I'm doing too much, not writing code.

02:48:32
<transcript>: from

02:48:33
<transcript>: From game.

02:48:40
<transcript>: I do well, I did. I think I think that might have been part of, yes, lent.

02:48:43
<transcript>: Oh really.

02:48:48
<transcript>: No. Ls is running.

02:48:51
<transcript>: That's where I do my eslant.

02:48:54
<transcript>: Don't use this lent. What do you use.

02:48:58
<transcript>: You don't limp.

02:48:58
<transcript>: look at you

02:48:59
<transcript>: Look at you.

02:49:02
<transcript>: Is there a reason I shouldn't be linting.

02:49:04
fragaverage: I can't believe this much stuff breaks from a simple OS upgrade

02:49:04
<transcript>: Beats me.

02:49:13
ohmymndy: Good afternoon everyone! tuning in from the porch of my mobile home in France (I am on holiday)! Only listening because of data limits and slow Internet doesn't do the stream justice 😁

02:49:13
<transcript>: Honestly, I only use it because everybody uses it. Maybe I don't even use it. This needs to be game router.

02:49:17
<transcript>: I don't feel like it adds much to my life.

02:49:33
<transcript>: I said that in a very like, dramatic way doesn't add any meaning to any of this game router game. Okay. So now it should be actually part of the thing, right.

02:49:43
<transcript>: Okay. It infers everything.

02:49:47
<transcript>: Argument doesn't even be input.

02:49:52
<transcript>: Oh.

02:49:52
<transcript>: gotcha

02:49:59
<transcript>: Gotcha and it's not gamed that new anymore. It's okay. So this should be valid.

02:50:07
<transcript>: Oh, look at that.

02:50:12
<transcript>: Look at that. This is that TypeScript. Goodness. They speak of.

02:50:14
<transcript>: So Let's.

02:50:19
<transcript>: Delete in brackets. What is this? Input? No. Name.

02:50:30
<transcript>: It's what are gonna type game new name shares I have a frame name.

02:50:30
<transcript>: what

02:50:31
<transcript>: What.

02:50:31
<transcript>: use

02:50:33
<transcript>: Use mutation.

02:50:33
<transcript>: what does this look like

02:50:34
<transcript>: What does this look like.

02:50:39
<transcript>: Dang new.

02:50:39
<transcript>: op

02:50:44
<transcript>: Ops has oh, is there gonna be like a data or something? Oh, Geez.

02:50:48
<transcript>: How do I? How do I.

02:50:50
<transcript>: How do I.

02:50:50
<transcript>: tab

02:50:52
<transcript>: Tab into that thing.

02:50:52
<transcript>: oh there we go

02:50:53
<transcript>: Oh, There we go.

02:50:56
<transcript>: I can't look at more.

02:50:56
<transcript>: five more

02:51:00
<transcript>: Five more. I want to see more. I guess we could do we do this.

02:51:04
<transcript>: What just happened.

02:51:04
<transcript>: in them

02:51:04
alenevill: what's that terminal app on the left?

02:51:10
<transcript>: In them terminated by signal address boundary error. That looks bad. That looks really bad, doesn't it.

02:51:15
<transcript>: Does it just kill my team Ox? No, I'm still in Tmach. It just killed in them. Okay.

02:51:22
<transcript>: I'm using the latest of everything. It's even the latest Vinvin. This is just bad.

02:51:27
laytanl_: One of those days huh

02:51:30
oskrm: howdy

02:51:31
<transcript>: Oh, this is this is just par in Linux land. I could just use this stuff.

02:51:39
<transcript>: Oh, so I'm at least limited to just the Mac OS beta.

02:51:42
<transcript>: That's awesome.

02:51:42
<transcript>: well

02:51:43
<transcript>: Well.

02:51:46
<transcript>: Client Three with exit code.

02:51:51
<transcript>: Oh Yeah.

02:52:01
<transcript>: Okay.

02:52:05
<transcript>: I think it's that it could be.

02:52:07
<transcript>: Yeah, Yeah.

02:52:12
<transcript>: Okay.

02:52:17
<transcript>: There we go. Now, if I do. Hello, Mutate. You're saying.

02:52:25
<transcript>: Can we say okay. So I would do that in something in response. I guess I could just do it.

02:52:28
<transcript>: React.

02:52:28
<transcript>: man

02:52:32
<transcript>: Man I fall out of love with React a little bit more every day when I think about.

02:52:32
<transcript>: some of this stuff

02:52:36
<transcript>: Some of this stuff, like, I want to run code at the beginning, so I'm just gonna do all this.

02:52:36
<transcript>: zombie

02:52:38
<transcript>: Zombie.

02:52:41
<transcript>: That's it.

02:52:45
<transcript>: Can I code actions or code actions? Working.

02:52:48
<transcript>: Yes.

02:52:48
<transcript>: ethania slant

02:52:49
<transcript>: Ethania slant thing.

02:52:52
<transcript>: This Month working.

02:52:55
<transcript>: Oh, really? Okay. Maybe it's not then.

02:52:55
<transcript>: so

02:52:57
<transcript>: So I would do like, Hello.

02:52:57
<transcript>: muta

02:52:57
oskrm: wait till you see Svelte :P

02:52:59
<transcript>: Mutate.

02:52:59
<transcript>: i guess

02:53:01
<transcript>: I guess I don't need to do async.

02:53:03
<transcript>: I'll just do it like this.

02:53:07
<transcript>: What's.

02:53:13
<transcript>: Your.

02:53:13
<transcript>: well in this case

02:53:15
<transcript>: Well, in this case, I'm just inside this hook.

02:53:17
<transcript>: And I just want to like.

02:53:28
<transcript>: Actually look at things. Mutate name. Oh, variables. Okay. Yeah.

02:53:30
<transcript>: So.

02:53:36
<transcript>: Name. Okay. Wow. We're so close to have having done nothing.

02:53:39
<transcript>: Doing nothing.

02:53:39
<transcript>: this

02:53:43
<transcript>: This should be the new game mutation.

02:53:43
<transcript>: i'm definitely

02:53:53
<transcript>: I'm definitely not on Pace. I should have known, like, learning a new thing like this was not gonna be three new things on three beta software.

02:53:53
<transcript>: is not gonna work

02:53:54
<transcript>: Is not gonna work.

02:54:10
<transcript>: I thought I could do this in a stream. You know, I like, I'm terrible at decimating, but in my mind, I don't know. This was about a one stream thing, and it's turning into a not a one stream thing. What is this new game? Mutation data.

02:54:15
<transcript>: Oh, no, I didn't. I guess.

02:54:19
<transcript>: I don't think so. I didn't.

02:54:19
<transcript>: but i maybe

02:54:29
<transcript>: But I maybe I should. I don't know. So that's creating a new game when you hit it. I guess so. We should be able to go in and see, like in our Prisma studio.

02:54:31
<transcript>: Where was that.

02:54:33
zgredfred1: learn vim substitutes

02:54:38
<transcript>: Here. Oh, it's already up, so I just need to open it cuz. I got Rick rolled. Local host.

02:54:38
<transcript>: five

02:54:40
<transcript>: Five, five.

02:54:43
<transcript>: games

02:54:45
zgredfred1: or rename variable with lsp rename

02:54:48
<transcript>: Name a Wait. Check the what.

02:54:50
<transcript>: That's a good call.

02:54:50
<transcript>: it's a great call

02:54:54
<transcript>: It's a great call oh, oh, something's very bad.

02:55:04
<transcript>: Because it told me to.

02:55:08
<transcript>: I.

02:55:12
<transcript>: Just said that it's amazing dependency. And I was like, sure.

02:55:17
<transcript>: I can say forget you. We're just doing it once. Yeah.

02:55:17
<transcript>: well i guess

02:55:20
<transcript>: Well, I guess I don't know. How soon is this thing actually ready.

02:55:21
carlosgn: put the mutation outside the useeffect

02:55:26
<transcript>: On the first render.

02:55:32
<transcript>: Is why I hate yes, Lantern React and everything about my life right now.

02:55:41
<transcript>: That makes sense but we still got another issue cannot read property creative undefined.

02:55:45
<transcript>: Create Where did it say that.

02:55:52
<transcript>: Yeah? Everything's so that my resolution so bad? It's so hard to tell what's going on here.

02:55:59
<transcript>: It's making a request.

02:56:05
<transcript>: I don't know anything about TRPC. So.

02:56:08
<transcript>: Cannot read.

02:56:08
<transcript>: what

02:56:10
<transcript>: What's? That.

02:56:14
<transcript>: Okay.

02:56:14
<transcript>: let's

02:56:16
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:56:21
<transcript>: Well, maybe there's just like an obvious thing in the output here. No.

02:56:26
<transcript>: I can't just do that.

02:56:28
<transcript>: Okay.

02:56:28
<transcript>: do i need to research

02:56:31
<transcript>: Do I need to research the server? Surely not right.

02:56:42
<transcript>: Game new.

02:56:42
<transcript>: what was it

02:56:43
<transcript>: What was it.

02:56:48
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:56:48
<transcript>: i'm just gonna exit that

02:56:50
<transcript>: I'm just gonna exit. That okay. In here.

02:56:53
<transcript>: Game news.

02:56:53
<transcript>: oh

02:56:55
<transcript>: Oh, seriously.

02:56:57
<transcript>: Out of work.

02:56:59
<transcript>: I can just.

02:57:01
<transcript>: Undefinition sound.

02:57:03
<transcript>: Something I've broken.

02:57:06
<transcript>: Maybe restart.

02:57:06
<transcript>: lsp

02:57:08
<transcript>: Lsp research.

02:57:11
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:57:15
<transcript>: That sounds amazing. I want it.

02:57:19
oskrm: scammed :(

02:57:24
<transcript>: Over. Name or new? That was LSP? Saga. I kind of hate it. I don't know why I installed it.

02:57:29
<transcript>: Oh, I see.

02:57:32
carlosgn: you have to pass it as ["game.new"]

02:57:38
<transcript>: What happens? Lsp sorry. It does not like something. It does not like. I just need to get rid of LSD so it gets done.

02:57:42
<transcript>: Sorry if you're the author of LC Song Late and you didn't make it, did you.

02:57:42
<transcript>: so sorry

02:57:43
<transcript>: So sorry.

02:57:46
<transcript>: You have to pass it as game new.

02:57:46
<transcript>: okay

02:57:48
<transcript>: Okay.

02:57:50
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay.

02:57:50
<transcript>: game new

02:57:52
<transcript>: Game new that works.

02:57:52
<transcript>: i don't think that's

02:57:55
<transcript>: I don't think that's the issue. I think it's on the server side, and I think.

02:57:57
laytanl_: I don't know what lspsaga is either

02:57:59
<transcript>: Okay.

02:58:03
<transcript>: What do we have here? Mutation.

02:58:06
<transcript>: Hello. I'm just gonna delete all this.

02:58:11
<transcript>: So we have a new mutation.

02:58:11
<transcript>: this is our

02:58:15
<transcript>: This is our game. Router. Takes a name minimum of one.

02:58:24
<transcript>: Oh, game, yeah. Oh, there's more Prisma stuff.

02:58:28
<transcript>: Yeah. So there's more prison stuff I got to do. Maybe.

02:58:30
<transcript>: I don't know.

02:58:40
<transcript>: I don't know I'm side of my element let's see types? No.

02:58:46
<transcript>: Oh, wait.

02:58:48
<transcript>: This thing I have to do.

02:58:52
<transcript>: Patient. Is this for each thing or no.

02:58:53
fragaverage: Nope not in there

02:59:00
<transcript>: Okay.

02:59:05
<transcript>: So maybe o context.

02:59:08
<transcript>: Context.

02:59:13
<transcript>: Okay.

02:59:24
<transcript>: Here.

02:59:26
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:59:30
<transcript>: Console that log context at Prisma. Okay.

02:59:30
<transcript>: i shouldn't

02:59:33
<transcript>: I shouldn't have research server right.

02:59:43
<transcript>: I ask because I just my overlay app as a custom server and I have to restart every time I do anything, but I think I don't have to do that anymore.

02:59:50
<transcript>: That's what I'm looking for.

02:59:52
<transcript>: I scrolled past it.

02:59:59
<transcript>: Oh, right here. Model verification. Oh, yeah, no.

03:00:02
<transcript>: Do you see it? Session.

03:00:05
<transcript>: Exam.

03:00:10
<transcript>: We didn't generate something. Is there a prison step? Where I did the prison step.

03:00:10
<transcript>: we

03:00:13
<transcript>: We generated on prison, right.

03:00:22
<transcript>: I don't know. I don't know. Let's restart the server just in case that works. And I'd feel real bad if I did a lot of other stuff.

03:00:27
<transcript>: So we just restarted server if we refresh.

03:00:29
<transcript>: It worked.

03:00:29
<transcript>: yeah

03:00:31
1337cookietv: I dont think prisma can hot reload.

03:00:35
<transcript>: Yeah. So apparently, if you add stuff to your prison schema, you have to restart. Is that the Heuristic here.

03:00:42
<transcript>: Okay.

03:00:49
<transcript>: So it double fired.

03:00:55
<transcript>: Created a couple that's to be expected and use a factor right Strick mode.

03:00:57
<transcript>: You don't do react.

03:00:58
1337cookietv: I haven't look in a while though

03:01:04
carlosgn: i think you have to push the schemas changes

03:01:06
<transcript>: It's like I'm looking to you because I just know you have answers to everything. And then I remember you don't use react because you're way cooler than that.

03:01:10
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay.

03:01:13
fragaverage: shrugs

03:01:14
<transcript>: I need a I need a quick win? So we did the.

03:01:14
<transcript>: we made this

03:01:14
carlosgn: prisma db push

03:01:14
fragaverage: LUL

03:01:16
<transcript>: We made this thing happen.

03:01:16
<transcript>: i don't know how

03:01:17
<transcript>: I don't know how.

03:01:27
<transcript>: Useful it is yet. We're gonna get there. We're gonna get a working game. It's not. Maybe not multiplayer. We're gonna get something working. I don't know how long you have DAX, but we're gonna get it working.

03:01:33
<transcript>: I want to see real quick. I'm gonna just I want to disable LC sock X this time is driving crazy.

03:01:35
<transcript>: Actually.

03:01:38
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:01:40
<transcript>: We're just gonna leave.

03:01:40
<transcript>: not do all

03:01:43
<transcript>: Not do all this right.

03:01:46
<transcript>: That's all I have to add. Key binds for.

03:01:48
<transcript>: Jump back.

03:01:51
<transcript>: Let's see. Lsp? Config.

03:01:56
<transcript>: Here. Yeah. Go to definition. We just want the vanilla. Go to definition. You know, I'm saying.

03:01:56
<transcript>: yes

03:01:58
<transcript>: Yes.

03:01:58
<transcript>: i'm

03:02:02
<transcript>: I'm tired. Lc Saga I don't use the I don't use it.

03:02:05
<transcript>: Okay. So like that.

03:02:08
<transcript>: And then we're gonna just I'm just gonna do this.

03:02:11
<transcript>: No GG.

03:02:15
<transcript>: Like that.

03:02:17
<transcript>: Say like that.

03:02:19
<transcript>: Source.

03:02:28
<transcript>: This. I guess I'm just gonna restart them in anyway. Do I need to do anything else? I guess I'm gonna remove it from plugins.

03:02:39
<transcript>: Install that thing. Yeah. Get out of here.

03:02:46
<transcript>: I regret this. Oh, we just updated a bunch of stuff. More bleeding edge. Oh, we got the light as the cloak. Thanks, laden.

03:02:46
<transcript>: adap

03:02:49
<transcript>: Adapt latent. You'll see him in tag.

03:02:49
<transcript>: he

03:02:56
<transcript>: He made in them cloak in them. It's awesome. Hydrosecrets and environment. Yeah, Yeah.

03:02:58
<transcript>: It's pretty great. Okay.

03:03:01
<transcript>: Let's go back here.

03:03:03
<transcript>: Quick.

03:03:03
<transcript>: and then

03:03:10
<transcript>: And then okay, should now be without that stupid LC saga. So we're on our page.

03:03:10
<transcript>: now if i

03:03:12
<transcript>: Now if I go to definition on something.

03:03:18
<transcript>: Yeah. Yeah. So you're saying if I do this, it'll take me to the back end.

03:03:30
<transcript>: Oh, it does. There you go.

03:03:34
<transcript>: You can do it on game new.

03:03:34
<transcript>: happening right there

03:03:34
imanyone: Anyone know the terminal emulator he's using?

03:03:35
<transcript>: Happening right there.

03:03:44
kuzmaisgoat: temrinal emulator?

03:03:51
<transcript>: Okay. Okay. Let's do something meaningful here.

03:03:56
<transcript>: Terminally Emulator is alacrity.

03:03:56
<transcript>: who's mal

03:04:07
<transcript>: Who's Malz. Welcome to Chat. I hate being less interactive with chat. Bad hair today. Not working. Sorry. Sorry about that. Thanks for the follow Mobi keys. Yeah, we were using the latest.

03:04:07
<transcript>: macos

03:04:10
<transcript>: Macos. And it broke everything. I can do this for you.

03:04:10
<transcript>: i can do this

03:04:16
<transcript>: I can do this like this. Manually bad hair day. Here it comes. You spent your 500 points. You're gonna get.

03:04:16
<transcript>: some bad hair

03:04:19
<transcript>: Some bad hair day. There it is.

03:04:19
imanyone: Ahh alacrity, thanks!

03:04:21
<transcript>: Okay.

03:04:21
<transcript>: look at all

03:04:27
<transcript>: Look at all that fixed up. When you guys show back up on Wednesday. Next week, I'm gonna be a new man. I'm gonna have had five days off.

03:04:27
<transcript>: hanging out with

03:04:33
<transcript>: Hanging out with my family in a hotel room. Okay. Maybe I'll be worse. We'll see that might be worse, but.

03:04:36
<transcript>: I'm gonna have my overlay fixed.

03:04:36
<transcript>: just wait and

03:04:52
<transcript>: Just wait and see. I'm gonna have a little bit of time this weekend before we leave. I might get a fixed step, but I'm not streaming tomorrow. That's the tradeoff. So heads up. I won't be here. Don't show up. My new username next week will be Adam Dev. So also you won't be able to find me next week. I'm basically starting over on Twitch. That's what I'm hearing.

03:04:55
<transcript>: No one will know who I am. Okay.

03:04:55
<transcript>: zach we're gonna do

03:04:56
<transcript>: Zach, we're gonna do something real.

03:05:02
<transcript>: I kind of jokingly said it earlier. How long do you have DAX? You just tell me when you need to go.

03:05:02
fragaverage: I showed up yesterday, not knowing you don't stream wednesdays

03:05:06
<transcript>: Okay.

03:05:12
<transcript>: This active uses. Okay, save. Okay, we're just getting rid of some stuff.

03:05:18
<transcript>: If I just do bit like that is gonna delete all of now I wanted to see.

03:05:20
<transcript>: Okay.

03:05:24
<transcript>: That.

03:05:29
<transcript>: Alright. We got a main. Now Let's.

03:05:31
<transcript>: Do something.

03:05:36
<transcript>: Favorite of all whoever you are? I'm trying to stay focused.

03:05:41
<transcript>: Main.

03:05:45
<transcript>: No, no articleing tag.

03:05:56
<transcript>: Here's a Div. We're gonna put stuff in this, so we want to have let's see if we're gonna lay this out. I'm just gonna pretend like there's a game loaded right now, and we're gonna then, like, go back and do the back end, right.

03:05:58
<transcript>: You know, I'm saying.

03:06:01
<transcript>: Yeah. So we're gonna build like a basic.

03:06:01
<transcript>: basically

03:06:03
<transcript>: Basically, out, we're gonna have an image.

03:06:07
<transcript>: We're gonna fake it. This is gonna have source.

03:06:10
<transcript>: the public images

03:06:12
<transcript>: the images

03:06:18
<transcript>: What I'm gonna guess that that is.

03:06:21
<transcript>: Alt.

03:06:25
<transcript>: Service.

03:06:28
<transcript>: Resource logo.

03:06:35
<transcript>: Okay, we did it. Dynamodb. We're done image source. I'm gonna say width.

03:06:35
<transcript>: width

03:06:37
<transcript>: Width equals.

03:06:54
<transcript>: How do you do? You don't use next. You don't use react. You avoid all of the annoying things in my life that by just not using them like this is annoying to me having to set a width. I wonder if I can just do let's do this class name wit.

03:06:54
<transcript>: i don't know

03:06:55
<transcript>: I don't know.

03:06:55
<transcript>: hi di

03:06:57
<transcript>: Hi Dirty Too Aspect ratio.

03:06:57
<transcript>: ratio

03:07:00
<transcript>: Ratio. What is it.

03:07:02
<transcript>: Aspect.

03:07:04
<transcript>: Where.

03:07:04
<transcript>: then i'll

03:07:06
<transcript>: Then I'll have to do the height. Maybe.

03:07:08
<transcript>: Maybe.

03:07:21
<transcript>: That works. Do not use image tag. I will use what I want to use ESLint. Now I just wish I didn't have eslante. You know.

03:07:21
<transcript>: i

03:07:22
<transcript>: I can find.

03:07:25
codingbrah: Haha :D

03:07:28
<transcript>: I want to ignore this, but I have no code actions. Is that thing.

03:07:33
<transcript>: Come on.

03:07:33
<transcript>: why is it

03:07:37
<transcript>: Why is it saying that if it's not a thing I can do something about, you know.

03:07:38
kuzmaisgoat: eslint has been overkill imo, prettier + typescript has done justice

03:07:38
cowfacedude99: raid!!!!!

03:07:45
<transcript>: Averse. Whoa. 74 Raiders. Favors welcome. You picked a great day to watch? Terrible stream.

03:07:45
<transcript>: i hope you guys

03:07:46
aivars_meijers: Nice hair cut

03:07:48
<transcript>: I hope you guys had a better stream than this one has been.

03:07:52
schrew: LUL

03:07:53
<transcript>: It's been tough. I have updated to the latest Mac OS last night. I'll try and keep this short.

03:07:53
<transcript>: everything is

03:07:56
<transcript>: Everything is broken? My overlays are broken.

03:07:56
<transcript>: everything

03:07:59
<transcript>: Everything's broken. We had OBS crash once.

03:08:08
<transcript>: But we're hanging in here. We got DAX with us. If DAX is still here, I don't know. It could have DAX off in it. No, he's still here. Okay. We're trying to build. Aw.

03:08:11
<transcript>: aware

03:08:11
<transcript>: aware don't do it

03:08:13
<transcript>: Aware. Don't do it.

03:08:14
digital_dummy: aivarsCelebrate

03:08:22
<transcript>: You're experiencing it in real time. I did it last night, right before I went to sleep. So I woke up this morning. I started the stream. This is the first I've used the new Mecholic so dumb.

03:08:26
<transcript>: We're building AW guess.

03:08:26
<transcript>: with the

03:08:42
<transcript>: With the T three stack. Aw, guess is gonna be a game where you're presented with an AWS service icon. There's like 300 A Tob services and you have multiple choice. You have to guess what is the service and we're gonna make it multiplayer eventually. Probably not today at this base, but that's what we're working on.

03:08:42
<transcript>: and

03:08:45
aivars_meijers: I have Ventura un other partition, but didn't try to stream from it

03:08:51
<transcript>: And I'm still trying to learn Neovem and Tmachs and how to use a Mac, and basically everything about streaming, so welcome.

03:08:51
<transcript>: we're in progress

03:08:52
aivars_meijers: Xcode works fine ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

03:08:53
<transcript>: We're in progress.

03:09:01
<transcript>: And I just want to tell Eslan to leave me on on this and I don't have code actions so that's that feels bad. I could manually type it in.

03:09:04
<transcript>: I don't know how to make a comment.

03:09:08
<transcript>: Like that's how I would do a comment. Okay.

03:09:11
<transcript>: So let's do this.

03:09:13
<transcript>: Oh, Geez.

03:09:15
<transcript>: Let's do this.

03:09:15
<transcript>: eslint

03:09:20
<transcript>: Eslint? Who knows who knows it thisable night? Fine, yeah, Yeah.

03:09:20
<transcript>: but i have like

03:09:25
<transcript>: But I have, like, save the thing, right? I have to say what thing I want to disable. We did it up here.

03:09:25
<transcript>: react

03:09:31
<transcript>: React, hooks, exhaustive depth, but I can't even get it to show me what is the issue? Oh, you know what.

03:09:31
<transcript>: code act

03:09:34
<transcript>: Code actions. All of that was in LSP? Saga ha.

03:09:39
<transcript>: I showed that, didn't I? I said, Get out of here. Lsp saga.

03:09:39
<transcript>: what did i get in

03:09:41
<transcript>: What did I get in return.

03:09:41
<transcript>: with

03:09:44
aivars_meijers: I have to run, have a great stream 👋

03:09:44
<transcript>: With this is this plugins.

03:09:44
<transcript>: ls

03:09:49
<transcript>: Lsi config so I've got add some key binds here like my control.

03:09:54
<transcript>: Oh, I don't have rename anymore. That was Lchaga. Oh, now I'm regretting it.

03:10:00
<transcript>: Oh, you do. Can I just do it with builtin? Okay. So let's just pull up LSP.

03:10:04
<transcript>: Udim LSP. Config.

03:10:06
<transcript>: Key binding.

03:10:08
<transcript>: Maps.

03:10:11
laytanl_: All of that is doable builtin

03:10:11
<transcript>: That would be great.

03:10:13
cowfacedude99: the Image element has apparently some optimizations specific for next. So I think it would be a good idea for next

03:10:17
<transcript>: I think for the follow amazingly five K SK amazingly SK.

03:10:24
cowfacedude99: it's vim.lsp.buf.rename() @adamelmore

03:10:24
<transcript>: And then Tura on another partition, but didn't try to stream from it. Yeah, avers good call.

03:10:24
<transcript>: xco

03:10:26
<transcript>: Xcode works fine. I don't use that.

03:10:33
<transcript>: But good to know if I did. At least I'd have something that worked fine right now. I have nothing. Nothing works fine.

03:10:33
<transcript>: see you

03:10:42
daeeyy: yeah, and vim.lsp.buf.code_action() also

03:10:48
<transcript>: See you. Sorry. I should have looked when you rated. I always, yeah, I'm late, digital dummy. Welcome to Chat. Nice haircut. Oh, yeah, yeah. Do we have that on right now? Okay. So I don't always have this hair. And I'm gonna turn it off now because.

03:10:51
<transcript>: Just part of my overlays? And they're broken today.

03:10:51
<transcript>: raid

03:10:56
<transcript>: Raid. I'm just catching up on Chat. Here. Coding bra. Welcome to chat.

03:10:59
<transcript>: Frag showed up yesterday.

03:10:59
<transcript>: yeah

03:11:01
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't I don't stream on windows.

03:11:07
<transcript>: Yeah. I'm not liking a slip. Who's malls. I think I want to get rid of it.

03:11:11
<transcript>: Did you pay something.

03:11:11
<transcript>: somewhere

03:11:11
nexxeln: hii

03:11:12
<transcript>: Somewhere.

03:11:12
<transcript>: back

03:11:14
<transcript>: Back.

03:11:18
<transcript>: Someone already did it.

03:11:22
<transcript>: Why don't I see it in Twitch chat? Here.

03:11:22
<transcript>: somebody

03:11:26
<transcript>: Somebody post. Okay, I'm sorry.

03:11:26
<transcript>: vim lsp

03:11:32
<transcript>: Vim? Lsp? Buff? Rename. Okay. I was thinking more like a whole line that I could just copy. But I guess.

03:11:36
<transcript>: Let's see. No, I can. I can get it.

03:11:36
<transcript>: lsp

03:11:41
<transcript>: Lsp config. Lsd config. Here we go. I can just copy one of these. Right.

03:11:41
<transcript>: i'll just

03:11:45
<transcript>: I'll just change it so I want to do Gr for rename.

03:11:48
<transcript>: So Gr is rename.

03:11:51
<transcript>: Loua vim? Lsp? Buff.

03:11:51
<transcript>: code action

03:11:57
<transcript>: Code action. Oh, that's code action. We'll do that first code action. Oh, it's got, like, type ahead. What am I thinking.

03:11:59
<transcript>: Leader.

03:12:02
<transcript>: I don't have to say leader. Right. That's assumed.

03:12:04
<transcript>: Is that assumed.

03:12:07
cowfacedude99: after all the effort to set eslint?

03:12:07
<transcript>: Oh Yeah.

03:12:07
<transcript>: leader

03:12:08
daglee: There is a better way to set keybindings.

03:12:10
<transcript>: Leader CA.

03:12:16
<transcript>: Renamedia. Yeah, I do Gr for some reason because that was what somebody else did, I guess.

03:12:16
<transcript>: code

03:12:21
<transcript>: Code action. Is that right? There's a better way, Dagley says.

03:12:26
<transcript>: Okay, Cool. We do. Leader CA.

03:12:26
<transcript>: we

03:12:30
<transcript>: We do leader Greg are even.

03:12:33
<transcript>: Vr for Renaissance.

03:12:36
cowfacedude99: I have it on <m-cr> for code actions.

03:12:37
<transcript>: Rename, look at that. Feels good.

03:12:44
<transcript>: Somebody says there's a better way, though welcome to Chat Dagli. There's a better way to set key bindings. I have it on.

03:12:44
<transcript>: mcr

03:12:46
daglee: vim.keymap.set

03:12:48
<transcript>: Mcr for Code actions. What's in.

03:12:53
<transcript>: By literally oh, modify meta. It's your Medicaid.

03:12:59
cowfacedude99: that's alt+cr

03:12:59
<transcript>: I know. He says.

03:12:59
<transcript>: yeah i think

03:13:01
<transcript>: Yeah, I think that's a modifier key.

03:13:01
<transcript>: alt cr

03:13:04
<transcript>: Alt Cr thing here we go, all Tr.

03:13:05
daeeyy: @daglee ah yeah, heard about that recently.  Now I have to update my config

03:13:06
<transcript>: triggering

03:13:06
<transcript>: triggering i could do

03:13:15
<transcript>: Triggering I could do. Vim came out seven. I think we are doing Vim keynote set. No. Then maybe I end up. We're doing it. Something here. For some reason. I don't know why.

03:13:15
<transcript>: after

03:13:17
<transcript>: After the language attached.

03:13:19
<transcript>: Yeah. I don't know why we're not doing.

03:13:24
<transcript>: I think.

03:13:24
<transcript>: key ma

03:13:27
<transcript>: Key maps. I think we do that.

03:13:27
<transcript>: yeah

03:13:30
daglee: with vim.keymap.set you don't need don't need the whole "<cmd>lua ..."

03:13:31
<transcript>: Yeah. In another file in Maps. So I think we're doing that here.

03:13:31
<transcript>: but for

03:13:37
<transcript>: But for some reason in this file, I wasn't using a new shiny. Well, maybe we should do it.

03:13:44
<transcript>: Maybe we should with seem as you don't need the whole command Lua. That sounds nice.

03:13:49
<transcript>: Maybe I'll do that later. We'll just like.

03:13:49
<transcript>: to do

03:13:50
<transcript>: To do.

03:13:50
<transcript>: use

03:13:51
cowfacedude99: @adamelmore don't do that in this case, mainly because the on attach are buffer specific.

03:13:52
<transcript>: Use then key map.

03:13:52
<transcript>: set

03:13:58
<transcript>: Set I don't want to do it right now just cuz I'm taking for ever already so geo GRS reader is rename.

03:13:58
<transcript>: and then

03:13:59
<transcript>: And then.

03:13:59
<transcript>: let

03:14:02
<transcript>: Let's go back here.

03:14:10
<transcript>: Lsp? Saga? What else do I want? Else? Am I missing? Code, actions.

03:14:21
<transcript>: Range. So in visual mode does the range for the code action? I guess I'm gonna leave that out for now. I guess that's probably something that is built in without LC saga.

03:14:23
<transcript>: I've got go to definition.

03:14:23
<transcript>: what else

03:14:29
<transcript>: What else? Diagnostic. Jump. Next. This one is important. I use that constantly, and I miss it already.

03:14:29
<transcript>: hover doc

03:14:32
<transcript>: Hover, Doc, I gotta add that Geez.

03:14:34
<transcript>: Signature helper.

03:14:36
<transcript>: Capital J.

03:14:37
<transcript>: jap okay yeah

03:14:38
<transcript>: Jap. Okay. Yeah.

03:14:41
<transcript>: Okay. I'm gonna copy all these.

03:14:47
<transcript>: I'm gonna copy all these and just translate them into LSP.

03:14:47
<transcript>: config

03:14:48
<transcript>: Config.

03:14:56
<transcript>: Sorry we won't be doing Neil. Them config the entire stream. Unless that's what you like. And then maybe we will.

03:14:58
<transcript>: Why is that.

03:14:58
<transcript>: this is lu

03:15:00
cowfacedude99: there's a way to set them buffer specific inside vim.keymap.set but I would not go there.

03:15:00
<transcript>: This is Lua.

03:15:00
<transcript>: so is that

03:15:06
<transcript>: So. Is that right? Okay. I've just done something terrible. What have I done? Just start deleting stuff.

03:15:15
<transcript>: Hey, it was just that trailing that one little trailing some Python.

03:15:15
<transcript>: okay

03:15:17
<transcript>: Okay.

03:15:22
<transcript>: Now we're good.

03:15:24
<transcript>: So let's add.

03:15:30
<transcript>: Control? G.

03:15:37
<transcript>: Do I want that one.

03:15:39
<transcript>: I think so.

03:15:41
<transcript>: Command.

03:15:41
<transcript>: lua

03:15:44
<transcript>: Lua vim? Lsp? Buff.

03:15:44
<transcript>: diagnostic

03:15:47
<transcript>: Diagnostic jump. Next is that built in.

03:15:51
<transcript>: I don't think that's.

03:15:51
<transcript>: there anything

03:15:53
<transcript>: There anything for that.

03:15:56
daglee: Diagnostics functions are in  vim.diagnostic.goto_next()

03:16:04
<transcript>: Okay. Cafes. I'm with you. We won't do that. There's a way to set them.

03:16:06
<transcript>: Go to.

03:16:06
<transcript>: so buff

03:16:11
<transcript>: So buff. Go to you're, not buff. Lsp.

03:16:15
<transcript>: Diagnostic.

03:16:17
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:16:17
<transcript>: go

03:16:18
<transcript>: Go to.

03:16:22
<transcript>: Diagnostic or diagnostics.

03:16:26
<transcript>: I just don't have any.

03:16:26
<transcript>: like

03:16:27
<transcript>: Like.

03:16:38
anouran: it's just vim.diagnostic, not vim.lsp.diag

03:16:39
<transcript>: Diagnostic go to next and then I should probably do a back than I want to the next one.

03:16:39
<transcript>: a hover

03:16:43
daeeyy: Yeah I have vim.diagnostic.goto_prev without lsp as well

03:16:43
cowfacedude99: vim.diagnostic vim.lsp.diagnostic is depreciated

03:16:44
<transcript>: A Hover CTRL K. Wait, we already have that here. Yeah, I think I uncommon in that a second ago.

03:16:44
<transcript>: and then

03:16:48
<transcript>: And then CK is signature help. I did use that some.

03:16:52
<transcript>: That is an insert mode.

03:17:05
<transcript>: Deck vim. Diagnostics, not LSP.

03:17:06
daglee: They moved diagnostics out of lsp because it can be used for other stuff, like debuggers.

03:17:08
<transcript>: With Cafe, said.

03:17:10
<transcript>: Sure.

03:17:10
<transcript>: the

03:17:12
<transcript>: The coffee, says.

03:17:15
<transcript>: Cafe says it's deprecated.

03:17:22
<transcript>: Go to There we go. Now. I've got this stuff. Dan.

03:17:23
oskrm: you can try them in vim

03:17:24
<transcript>: Okay.

03:17:26
<transcript>: So.

03:17:26
<transcript>: ck

03:17:28
<transcript>: Ck is supposed to be.

03:17:28
<transcript>: signature help

03:17:30
<transcript>: Signature help. Did you say that was something.

03:17:30
<transcript>: i'm gonna be done

03:17:32
<transcript>: I'm gonna be done.

03:17:35
oskrm: :

03:17:36
<transcript>: Let's P.

03:17:36
<transcript>: sign

03:17:38
<transcript>: Signature help.

03:17:47
<transcript>: That's CTRL K and insert mode. Yep. I've gotten used to that and then preview definition.

03:17:47
<transcript>: do i have that one

03:17:49
<transcript>: Do I have that one? Do I need that one.

03:17:52
<transcript>: Either.

03:18:04
<transcript>: Okay. Gp. I guess I don't have that map. Anything else.

03:18:06
<transcript>: Lua vim.

03:18:09
<transcript>: Lsp.

03:18:09
<transcript>: what do you say

03:18:11
<transcript>: What do you say.

03:18:13
<transcript>: Preview.

03:18:18
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, I've already got GD. Okay.

03:18:18
<transcript>: but is there

03:18:21
<transcript>: But is there a preview definition.

03:18:24
<transcript>: Okay.

03:18:24
<transcript>: okay

03:18:26
<transcript>: Okay, cool.

03:18:30
daglee: you have insert on the last 2 bindings.

03:18:31
<transcript>: Let's source it.

03:18:31
<transcript>: and

03:18:36
<transcript>: And is that everything? Yeah. I got rid of the LSP Saga's already gone.

03:18:36
<transcript>: sn

03:18:38
<transcript>: Snap. I.

03:18:41
<transcript>: Tell you.

03:18:53
<transcript>: Open. What was I in? I was in router or something. Bradr. Game? Sure.

03:18:53
<transcript>: so

03:18:57
<transcript>: So if you're like writing a function or if you're in a function.

03:18:57
<transcript>: let's

03:19:00
<transcript>: Let's say I was like.

03:19:00
<transcript>: here

03:19:01
<transcript>: Here.

03:19:09
<transcript>: You can do control K and it tells me like that stuff while I'm in insert mode. Yeah.

03:19:15
<transcript>: Okay.

03:19:18
<transcript>: Let's go back to.

03:19:18
<transcript>: index

03:19:26
<transcript>: Index kissing. So this is what I wanted to do. I wanted to maybe code actions work now because I just had them broken. Yeah. Oh, here we go.

03:19:30
<transcript>: Stable. So that's a very different. Oh, that's what LSP socket did.

03:19:33
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:19:37
<transcript>: Okay.

03:19:37
<transcript>: i just i

03:19:40
nexxeln: haha

03:19:42
<transcript>: I just. I had problems with LSP saga. Like there were times where just things didn't seem to work.

03:19:47
<transcript>: Comments Inside Children oh, and LLC Saga Sanga seemed to do that right. Whereas.

03:19:50
<transcript>: And could do that right.

03:19:57
<transcript>: I get I get it now I get the LF Sock appeal.

03:20:01
<transcript>: Oh, man. Okay. Well, we're gonna stick with this for now.

03:20:02
zeljkokerum: What do you guys think is trpc subscription and ws ready for production usage?

03:20:05
<transcript>: Okay. So we got our load.

03:20:09
laytanl_: I don't use lsp saga and have the nice select for code actions

03:20:12
<transcript>: What do you guys think is TrpC subscription and WebSocket ready for production usage? I don't know. Zeco.

03:20:12
<transcript>: sorry

03:20:12
laytanl_: let me see how

03:20:14
<transcript>: Sorry, Zeldjako. Welcome to chat.

03:20:17
<transcript>: Oh, there you go.

03:20:23
<transcript>: Thank you. Laden. Please do.

03:20:26
andom: Wassup

03:20:27
cowfacedude99: You can have nice view, I have been using telescope select-ui

03:20:27
<transcript>: Let's.

03:20:29
neochromer: pozz ZEljko

03:20:36
<transcript>: Insert on the last two bindings. Oh, Dagley, thank you for the catch. We'll go back next we'll knee them to you today. Hi. How you doing.

03:20:36
<transcript>: we're working on t

03:20:39
cowfacedude99: it's better than normal.

03:20:40
<transcript>: We're working on T. Three stuff, kind of mostly in Vim, I guess.

03:20:44
<transcript>: Tells telescopes like, Do I okay.

03:20:47
nexxeln: hi adam

03:20:49
daglee: I think you fixed it.

03:20:51
oskrm: mr Adam you owe "me a bad hair day"

03:20:52
<transcript>: There's something else. Oh, yeah? Zoko a Zelda selchico? Welcome to Chat. I don't know if I said that, but welcome.

03:21:00
<transcript>: Okay, we're going to go back here and fix this insert mode. That one's, right? That should be insert mode. All the others. Okay, we're good. Then.

03:21:02
laytanl_: Yeah I have telescope set up for that too, like @cowfacedude99 said

03:21:03
<transcript>: The second one, we delete it.

03:21:05
<transcript>: Logo.

03:21:10
<transcript>: This is going to come from like a round or something.

03:21:10
<transcript>: i can put those

03:21:13
<transcript>: I can put those on for you. There's my Ray bands.

03:21:18
<transcript>: Okay, Amazon DB DynamoDB.

03:21:22
<transcript>: Let's just we'll fake the data here. We'll say, like.

03:21:22
<transcript>: const

03:21:24
<transcript>: Const round.

03:21:24
<transcript>: equals

03:21:26
<transcript>: Equals we're just gonna fake all this.

03:21:29
<transcript>: Name. This is like the service.

03:21:29
<transcript>: that's

03:21:31
<transcript>: That's let's see.

03:21:37
laytanl_: https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-ui-select.nvim is doing that

03:21:39
<transcript>: What's that I made what accessible.

03:21:44
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, I just put resources.

03:21:49
<transcript>: I didn't put DynamoDB in there.

03:21:49
<transcript>: i'd give it away

03:21:50
<transcript>: I'd give it away with it.

03:21:50
<transcript>: so i guess

03:21:54
<transcript>: So I guess this will have a shape like this images.

03:22:00
<transcript>: Amazon Actually, the image can be derived from the service. Now.

03:22:01
nexxeln: today ct3a reached 6k stars

03:22:02
<transcript>: So choices.

03:22:06
<transcript>: Oh, but I can't derive it from the name.

03:22:07
zeljkokerum: One question, it uses EventEmiter which is inmemory emiter, just wondering how server works after build, is it always single instance, or there is some balancing on load which will obviously break connection

03:22:15
cowfacedude99: @nexxeln Congrats!!!!

03:22:23
<transcript>: Like I don't have to be super easy to just inspect and cheat because you can see the name of the image, but that's kind of what I got going right now. I've got obscure, I've got an obfuscate right.

03:22:23
nexxeln: ty @cowfacedude99

03:22:24
alan__rice: ultimate security

03:22:26
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:22:26
<transcript>: we'll hash them all

03:22:29
<transcript>: We'll hash them all. Okay, let's do that. It sounds fun.

03:22:34
<transcript>: I don't want to skip it. That sounds more fun than whatever I'm doing right now.

03:22:42
<transcript>: Let's go to public. Where is it public? So we have this folder of images and what we need to do.

03:22:45
fragaverage: make a dang game already LUL

03:22:46
<transcript>: Let's see what's go to.

03:22:49
<transcript>: Running around.

03:22:49
<transcript>: cd

03:22:50
fragaverage: deal with that later!

03:22:52
<transcript>: Cd Playground A To, B gas.

03:22:54
<transcript>: So in here.

03:22:57
<transcript>: We've got.

03:22:57
<transcript>: an images

03:22:58
<transcript>: An images.

03:22:58
<transcript>: this

03:23:02
<transcript>: This is our list of Services images we need to.

03:23:02
<transcript>: you're saying

03:23:08
<transcript>: You're saying if I Hashem, then it's something I can reverse. But I just don't care if someone else says, like they're gonna technically.

03:23:14
<transcript>: Okay. So do like a hash that can't be reversed.

03:23:19
neochromer: @adamelmore Zeljko, the Z is pronaunced as the S in "measure".. :D

03:23:23
neochromer: I hope I got that right @ZeljkoKerum

03:23:23
<transcript>: So I'll have to create, like, a map on the back end that maps.

03:23:23
<transcript>: the hash to

03:23:24
fragaverage: how will you know what logo is what

03:23:27
<transcript>: The hash to the actual service name. So what you're saying.

03:23:37
<transcript>: But I got to store the image with that hash name. And you're saying, just, I don't need to have a map. Just compute the hash I got you.

03:23:37
<transcript>: we're check

03:23:42
<transcript>: We're check. We're following. I'm following you. So I'm gonna write a little script.

03:23:46
<transcript>: Don't what's? That.

03:23:50
<transcript>: Well, I'm gonna start using script Kitkit.

03:23:51
fragaverage: db table, storing resource name to s3 key

03:23:53
<transcript>: Have you seen it.

03:24:10
<transcript>: I haven't either, but I want to start using it. I don't think I'm gonna do it right now because that's a whole nother thing to learn. And as we know, we've learned too many things. All right today on the stream, but I'm gonna start using it for all my little, like, oneoff stuff. But like, I think I'm just gonna write a note script. Probably.

03:24:13
<transcript>: So let's just do.

03:24:15
cowfacedude99: do a base64 encore for now and deal with it later.... @adamelmore

03:24:15
<transcript>: Touch.

03:24:18
<transcript>: Rename.

03:24:18
<transcript>: images

03:24:20
<transcript>: Images.

03:24:26
<transcript>: Thank you.

03:24:26
<transcript>: and then

03:24:30
<transcript>: And then in them Rename images.

03:24:35
<transcript>: So here's our little note script. We're gonna read all the files. So let's see.

03:24:37
<transcript>: Import.

03:24:49
<transcript>: Web Dev Two Web Dev to welcome.

03:24:53
<transcript>: And just looking at Jet to see if I miss anything I want to read.

03:24:57
<transcript>: The Z is pronounced as an S, as in measure Oh.

03:25:08
<transcript>: Sounds co. Did I say that totally wrong? I'm sorry. I'm an American that lives in the Midwest. I'm the worst version of Americans. I can't say anything.

03:25:15
<transcript>: Dv table storing street region or there is no frag the images we're going to.

03:25:15
<transcript>: what we're doing right now

03:25:19
<transcript>: What we're doing right now, we're like gonna hash the name of the service.

03:25:22
<transcript>: And then.

03:25:27
<transcript>: Send that down from the back end when we send each round of the game right.

03:25:30
<transcript>: So.

03:25:33
<transcript>: Images equals.

03:25:34
<transcript>: Read.

03:25:34
<transcript>: oh no

03:25:37
cowfacedude99: which hashing util are you going to use?

03:25:38
<transcript>: Oh, no, an on tide script. I can't do anything with that TypeScript.

03:25:43
<transcript>: It.

03:25:47
<transcript>: Is it my is it something with my LSP.

03:25:50
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:25:52
<transcript>: Ls flow.

03:25:56
<transcript>: Oh, well, I can attach it right. How do I do that.

03:26:01
<transcript>: What I do Somebody tell me.

03:26:08
<transcript>: Do a basic C four in code now and deal with it later.

03:26:11
<transcript>: The prop.

03:26:14
<transcript>: What's? That.

03:26:23
<transcript>: Right now I just want to get TypeScript. How do I get TS server attached to this thing.

03:26:25
<transcript>: Lsp.

03:26:29
<transcript>: And I've got something wrong on my config, I guess.

03:26:35
<transcript>: Anyone know how I would just. I mean, I can go into my.

03:26:35
<transcript>: if we need to

03:26:37
<transcript>: If we need to do something in here.

03:26:40
cowfacedude99: check your server config

03:26:43
<transcript>: File types. Here we go.

03:26:43
<transcript>: here we go

03:26:45
<transcript>: Here we go. Type. Script, type, script, react.

03:26:45
<transcript>: we want to

03:26:47
<transcript>: We want to do.

03:26:47
<transcript>: what

03:26:49
<transcript>: What.

03:26:49
<transcript>: that's good

03:26:50
<transcript>: That's good.

03:26:58
<transcript>: Oh, and it just by default, does it right.

03:27:00
<transcript>: Like that.

03:27:03
<transcript>: Okay, show that.

03:27:07
<transcript>: Let's try that.

03:27:19
<transcript>: Are you working just like that.

03:27:19
<transcript>: const imag

03:27:23
<transcript>: Const images equals FS that read.

03:27:23
<transcript>: dur

03:27:25
<transcript>: Dur.

03:27:26
<transcript>: durasync

03:27:26
<transcript>: durasync right

03:27:27
<transcript>: Durasync right.

03:27:35
<transcript>: Do I need to. Yeah. See, I think about that.

03:27:38
<transcript>: Because you said it.

03:27:42
<transcript>: But then do I do sink still if it's promises. Okay.

03:27:42
<transcript>: oh i

03:27:46
<transcript>: Oh, I just but it's sink.

03:27:46
<transcript>: alright

03:27:46
<transcript>: Alright.

03:27:48
<transcript>: You saying don't do sync.

03:27:52
<transcript>: I got you, I got you okay.

03:27:52
<transcript>: yeah that's

03:27:56
<transcript>: Yeah, that's better than a callback? I get it, I get the appeal.

03:27:56
<transcript>: so public

03:28:01
<transcript>: So public. Slash images, just like that. So there's our images.

03:28:10
<transcript>: What do you mean? No, it's not.

03:28:13
<transcript>: Here, let's do a V split.

03:28:17
<transcript>: Ha ha. I love them. Stuff like that. Now.

03:28:17
<transcript>: so i think

03:28:19
<transcript>: So I think it's just right here, right.

03:28:25
<transcript>: Yeah, I didn't rename it just so let's just run it so I can make sure.

03:28:25
<transcript>: it's a node

03:28:28
<transcript>: It's a node. Do I have to like node? Esm.

03:28:28
<transcript>: or

03:28:29
<transcript>: Or.

03:28:32
<transcript>: That just works. Okay, Rename images.

03:28:37
<transcript>: There we are. Okay, so there's our file names.

03:28:44
<transcript>: There we go. Feel good.

03:28:47
<transcript>: Okay.

03:28:47
<transcript>: so

03:28:52
<transcript>: So if we have our images now I'm going to for.

03:28:55
<transcript>: forgive

03:28:56
<transcript>: Forgive.

03:28:58
<transcript>: Image.

03:28:58
<transcript>: of

03:28:59
<transcript>: Of.

03:29:03
<transcript>: Images.

03:29:07
<transcript>: We're going to rename.

03:29:10
<transcript>: What'd you say you want to do? We want to do.

03:29:19
nexxeln: just do forEach?

03:29:22
<transcript>: Yeah. My problem with doing, like a basic floor is like, I don't think it's any less work to just do something that's not reversible, right.

03:29:22
<transcript>: import

03:29:25
<transcript>: Import Kypto from.

03:29:25
<transcript>: crypto

03:29:26
<transcript>: Crypto.

03:29:30
<transcript>: Do I need to.

03:29:35
<transcript>: Can someone.

03:29:41
<transcript>: Oh, I see.

03:29:47
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:29:47
<transcript>: exactly

03:29:51
<transcript>: Exactly. I don't know what the bin or what like security that provides.

03:29:51
<transcript>: i don't want people

03:29:55
<transcript>: I don't want people cheating, okay? Nope. No cheating. In this game. This is serious.

03:29:55
<transcript>: crypto

03:29:57
<transcript>: Crypto.

03:29:59
<transcript>: Indie how do I do this.

03:30:02
<transcript>: Create hash.

03:30:09
<transcript>: That.

03:30:12
<transcript>: And then the thing.

03:30:19
<transcript>: I just.

03:30:23
<transcript>: Update.

03:30:23
<transcript>: and then

03:30:25
<transcript>: And then image.

03:30:27
<transcript>: So okay.

03:30:32
<transcript>: Oh Yeah.

03:30:37
<transcript>: Digest. And then you pass in what.

03:30:41
<transcript>: X? Yeah.

03:30:41
daneoshiga: block console.aws access while playing, no cheating!

03:30:43
<transcript>: We'll go ahead.

03:30:46
<transcript>: Let me think about this for a second.

03:30:46
<transcript>: yes

03:30:47
<transcript>: Yes.

03:30:53
<transcript>: Okay. So hash. And then we're gonna just maybe I'll just create copies of them for now.

03:30:53
<transcript>: is that better

03:30:54
<transcript>: Is that better.

03:31:01
<transcript>: Yeah, yeah, that's a good call. Okay. So F right file. And we're gonna do.

03:31:01
<transcript>: path

03:31:04
<transcript>: Path. Now we'll just do.

03:31:08
<transcript>: Oh, is there.

03:31:12
<transcript>: What would I copy.

03:31:14
<transcript>: The better.

03:31:21
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, I guess I don't have the contents of our GitHub.

03:31:23
<transcript>: Oh, man.

03:31:23
<transcript>: okay

03:31:25
<transcript>: Okay, copy.

03:31:29
<transcript>: This is where I have this thing. Source, destination.

03:31:37
<transcript>: Oh, well, the image is already. Oh, this is the name. So I can just do.

03:31:41
<transcript>: Yeah. Pat that joint. So let's do this.

03:31:43
<transcript>: Const.

03:31:43
<transcript>: i'm hashing

03:31:47
<transcript>: I'm hashing the whole name with the SVG, and everything is that terrible.

03:31:49
<transcript>: I guess that's fine.

03:31:49
<transcript>: step

03:31:51
<transcript>: Step, fine.

03:31:51
<transcript>: that's

03:32:03
<transcript>: That's kind of fun. It's kind of odd because from the back end, like, you're gonna choose a winning service like this is the service that we're gonna use an image of. Do I want to have to, like, craft some SVG name? No, I don't think so.

03:32:18
<transcript>: Yeah, I'm gonna start. I'm gonna do okay. So here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna do equals. What is it? It's like I can do.

03:32:21
<transcript>: Path, parse or something.

03:32:28
<transcript>: Parse. Yeah. Image. And then I can do here.

03:32:30
<transcript>: You use net.

03:32:37
<transcript>: Use NodeX. You're so cool. I don't know. Do you just not even use node using bun or something? Oh, okay, okay.

03:32:42
<transcript>: So it gives you like the name.

03:32:42
<transcript>: and the extension

03:32:43
<transcript>: And the extension.

03:32:43
<transcript>: and

03:32:48
<transcript>: And I don't remember how I normally do this, but I would say, like, stripped equals.

03:32:53
<transcript>: Name that or does name not have maybe name doesn't have.

03:32:56
nexxeln: deno for scripts is goated

03:32:56
<transcript>: Only without extension? Yeah, yeah, perfect.

03:32:58
<transcript>: Okay.

03:33:05
<transcript>: So we have a name instead of let's see, I'm gonna get better at my horizontal navigation. There we go.

03:33:05
<transcript>: fs

03:33:10
<transcript>: Fs copy. So that's our hash with our name. What's it gonna do.

03:33:13
<transcript>: Oh path. So we'll do the path to it.

03:33:19
<transcript>: Old path throwing the open? Yeah, I need the old path.

03:33:19
<transcript>: would be

03:33:21
<transcript>: Would be.

03:33:21
<transcript>: fade

03:33:22
<transcript>: Fade.

03:33:29
<transcript>: Yeah, I guess so.

03:33:29
<transcript>: we'll be on this

03:33:32
<transcript>: We'll be on this again. We're just.

03:33:34
<transcript>: Not named the image.

03:33:34
<transcript>: right

03:33:36
<transcript>: Right.

03:33:45
<transcript>: Images.

03:33:53
<transcript>: Oh now no, no.

03:33:53
<transcript>: let's try that

03:33:55
<transcript>: Let's try that, let's try.

03:33:55
<transcript>: delete

03:33:56
<transcript>: Delete.

03:34:02
<transcript>: Two quote. Nope. That was way off. This is we're gonna do this.

03:34:04
daneoshiga: da"

03:34:10
<transcript>: Sometimes you just got a bail and do the easy thing in them. Okay, old path, new path is going to be.

03:34:15
<transcript>: A new path equals path. Dot, join, Baster.

03:34:18
<transcript>: Plus we're gonna do.

03:34:20
<transcript>: What like.

03:34:23
<transcript>: Hashed? Yeah.

03:34:23
<transcript>: and then

03:34:25
<transcript>: And then.

03:34:25
<transcript>: image

03:34:30
<transcript>: Image still is image. Yeah. Okay. So copy from what's up.

03:34:33
<transcript>: Oh, maybe not.

03:34:33
<transcript>: maybe not

03:34:34
<transcript>: Maybe not.

03:34:34
<transcript>: full pat

03:34:37
<transcript>: Full path, new path.

03:34:42
<transcript>: Always that you await. That.

03:34:48
<transcript>: What do we do with a hash? I gotta put the contents where the contents.

03:34:49
<transcript>: New path.

03:34:56
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. No. The hash is involved in the name. I don't want the image here.

03:34:56
<transcript>: yeah yeah

03:34:57
<transcript>: Yeah, Yeah.

03:34:57
<transcript>: so

03:34:59
<transcript>: So this is gonna be.

03:35:00
<transcript>: No.

03:35:05
<transcript>: Cool any.

03:35:09
<transcript>: Hash dot. What STG.

03:35:09
<transcript>: oh yeah

03:35:14
<transcript>: Oh yeah. So phone is around this. Let's just learn this. So CS.

03:35:16
<transcript>: csa

03:35:19
<transcript>: Csa, and then the thing I'm surrounded with, right.

03:35:19
<transcript>: cs

03:35:22
<transcript>: Csa, Tilde Nope.

03:35:22
<transcript>: nope

03:35:23
<transcript>: Nope.

03:35:28
<transcript>: How do I do that? Someone tell me invent surround. I want to. I want to practice this.

03:35:33
<transcript>: Cs.

03:35:38
cowfacedude99: ys for adding

03:35:39
<transcript>: For I'm doing inventory on stuff here. I want to do CSA.

03:35:39
<transcript>: be a quote

03:35:39
daglee: csw"?

03:35:42
<transcript>: Be a quote you're saying why s for adding Oh.

03:35:46
cowfacedude99: cs for changing

03:35:46
<transcript>: Ys so Ysa.

03:35:48
nexxeln: cs is for replacing i think

03:35:48
<transcript>: No.

03:35:52
<transcript>: The answer changing.

03:35:52
<transcript>: yeah there's nothing

03:35:56
<transcript>: Yeah. There's nothing around it. And I want to add something around it. You're saying CSW.

03:36:03
<transcript>: Csw Qu quote no. Where is that? Where does that take me.

03:36:07
<transcript>: To give up. I really want to surround this YS.

03:36:07
<transcript>: this

03:36:09
<transcript>: This is DA quote.

03:36:14
<transcript>: That do not anything in my in them.

03:36:15
cowfacedude99: ysaw'

03:36:17
<transcript>: Do we give up.

03:36:17
<transcript>: i guess we

03:36:20
<transcript>: I guess we give up oh, here we go cafes.

03:36:20
<transcript>: y

03:36:24
<transcript>: Ysa W, and then the quote.

03:36:29
<transcript>: Ysa? W quote. Now, what was the W four.

03:36:31
<transcript>: Word.

03:36:37
<transcript>: There's so many indents around it so hard, because it's like four different things. You have to chain. So YS.

03:36:40
nexxeln: word

03:36:42
<transcript>: Cuz I'm I'll show you I'm gonna add SVG to the end watch.

03:36:42
<transcript>: y is

03:36:44
<transcript>: Y is a W.

03:36:44
<transcript>: like this

03:36:46
<transcript>: Like this.

03:36:46
<transcript>: was it

03:36:49
<transcript>: Was it worth it? What do we think? Everybody.

03:36:49
<transcript>: i guess

03:36:51
<transcript>: I guess someday it'll be worth it when I'm fast.

03:36:53
cowfacedude99: ys around word

03:36:54
<transcript>: Just not fast right now.

03:36:54
<transcript>: okay

03:36:55
<transcript>: Okay.

03:37:03
<transcript>: Let's see, DC. See, we have productive. That was.

03:37:06
<transcript>: So we're.

03:37:06
<transcript>: our new

03:37:09
<transcript>: Our new path. Old path. Okay, I think I can run this thing now. Right.

03:37:13
<transcript>: Yellow. Oh, what did I just do.

03:37:15
nexxeln: @adamelmore the guest's video is gone

03:37:19
<transcript>: Yeah. Hopefully I'm still trying to learn. How do I go over there? It's like that now.

03:37:26
<transcript>: Like that. Yeah. Okay, let's try it again. Don't mess the qualify names, please.

03:37:26
<transcript>: oh

03:37:31
<transcript>: Oh, what do we do? But we awaited copy is not a function.

03:37:32
cowfacedude99: guest video is preview LUL

03:37:33
<transcript>: I meant something else.

03:37:41
nexxeln: lmao

03:37:49
<transcript>: I don't think it did. I think I ignored it. Oh, yeah, good. Copy. Source, destination? Yeah. Asynchronously copies the entire directory structure from sources to destination.

03:37:54
laytanl_: Pretty easy to remember though: 'ys' is constant for surround, then a motion (which is also used for any other thing, like yank or delete) and then the character to surround it with

03:37:54
<transcript>: If I just want to copy a single file, is that what I want.

03:38:00
<transcript>: Okay. What's? What's wrong here? Fs. Is it not in promises.

03:38:04
<transcript>: Because it follows Slimp key.

03:38:13
<transcript>: Ys is constant for surround, then a motion which is used for any other thing like Yankees, and then the character to surround it with.

03:38:19
<transcript>: Yeah, I guess that's true. The guest video is gone. You guys can see DAX. Oh.

03:38:24
<transcript>: We see Dax's screen. Do you know that that decks.

03:38:30
<transcript>: We see your screen somehow. On Pink. Are you sure your screens.

03:38:32
<transcript>: Wait.

03:38:32
<transcript>: no

03:38:37
<transcript>: No, I don't know how that's happening. It's like it's my screen. No.

03:38:42
<transcript>: Just heads up.

03:38:42
<transcript>: sharing your screen

03:38:43
<transcript>: Sharing Your screen.

03:38:46
<transcript>: What's? What's wrong here.

03:38:46
daglee: Also, you don't need to do around with basic text object. So ysaw" = ysw"

03:38:48
<transcript>: Copy is not a function.

03:38:52
zeljkokerum: it could be worse kekw

03:38:52
<transcript>: Fs is from promises.

03:38:56
<transcript>: Just happy old path, new path.

03:39:00
<transcript>: I need now. Options. Is optional.

03:39:02
<transcript>: That's weird.

03:39:06
<transcript>: I ride it.

03:39:09
<transcript>: And write the file. Let's try this.

03:39:14
<transcript>: Definitely doesn't like it.

03:39:15
nexxeln: LUL

03:39:25
<transcript>: To round with basic text objects so ysaw Qu quote equals YS W.

03:39:30
<transcript>: Oh, you don't need to do around with basic text object. Okay, good to know.

03:39:35
<transcript>: Who think DAX.

03:39:40
<transcript>: Okay.

03:39:42
<transcript>: I mean, I could not do promises.

03:39:56
<transcript>: Really.

03:39:59
<transcript>: So weird.

03:40:02
<transcript>: Fs from fist, promises.

03:40:10
<transcript>: Try. Just try to think. Okay.

03:40:13
cowfacedude99: @daglee I prefer aw mainly because that way I don't have to be on first char.

03:40:16
<transcript>: And delete to quote, look at that.

03:40:16
<transcript>: look at that

03:40:18
<transcript>: Look at that.

03:40:20
<transcript>: Word.

03:40:23
<transcript>: Reader, sink.

03:40:26
<transcript>: What's wrong with that.

03:40:30
<transcript>: And then.

03:40:32
<transcript>: Bleed word.

03:40:32
<transcript>: happy

03:40:36
<transcript>: Happy sync? Or is it just already sink? I don't know. Just like that.

03:40:41
<transcript>: Non function? What.

03:40:41
<transcript>: okay

03:40:44
<transcript>: Okay somehow. As if.

03:40:44
<transcript>: we couldn't

03:40:51
<transcript>: We couldn't go wrong anymore. Today, on the stream. I have to pee again. I don't know how that's possible. I mean, I am drinking a lot of water.

03:40:58
<transcript>: But I'm floating like I am bouncing now I can't go to break.

03:40:58
<transcript>: because

03:41:02
<transcript>: Because clearly break is not working. Actually try again. You know try DX.

03:41:08
<transcript>: I'm peeing. Either way, we'll see if there's a break or not. Okay. I'll be right back.

03:42:05
nexxeln: https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/fs.html#fspromisescpsrc-dest-options

03:43:31
<transcript>: Alright.

03:43:33
neochromer: So, hows life guys?

03:43:33
<transcript>: I feel so much better.

03:43:41
<transcript>: How's life? It's been better, neocromer. We're gonna go on vacation. That's gonna be great. Then.

03:43:46
<transcript>: I'm gonna recover from all this. So what's wrong here? Did you figure this out.

03:43:57
<transcript>: Wait. Did I actually hit save, though? Okay. Yeah, I did.

03:44:04
<transcript>: Fs CP is not a function.

03:44:07
<transcript>: We're sure in node 16.

03:44:11
<transcript>: Node FS.

03:44:13
<transcript>: You have to.

03:44:26
<transcript>: That my issue.

03:44:30
<transcript>: Copy, five.

03:44:30
<transcript>: okay i'm gonna

03:44:31
neochromer: Vacation from Twitch Streaming?

03:44:32
neochromer: cool :D

03:44:33
<transcript>: Okay, I'm gonna undo, and we're gonna go back to promises.

03:44:38
<transcript>: Right. I've been trying to get people to start doing that, you know.

03:44:41
<transcript>: This plan. I have not.

03:44:41
<transcript>: okay

03:44:47
<transcript>: Okay copy file is it same API and same signature Oops.

03:44:49
<transcript>: Oops.

03:44:52
<transcript>: Where I'm right here.

03:44:56
<transcript>: I learned too many things at once. Here we go.

03:45:02
<transcript>: No such file or directory? Oh, I gotta make the directory.

03:45:07
<transcript>: So there's no directory. I'm just gonna make it right now, right.

03:45:07
<transcript>: make

03:45:09
<transcript>: Make their.

03:45:09
<transcript>: public

03:45:11
<transcript>: Public images.

03:45:11
<transcript>: the hash

03:45:13
<transcript>: The hashed.

03:45:19
<transcript>: What's right now I personally supported on socket copy file.

03:45:27
<transcript>: At some point we could run into a macOS beta issue.

03:45:33
<transcript>: That's what I said. What.

03:45:38
<transcript>: Copy file published.

03:45:38
<transcript>: has

03:45:39
<transcript>: Hashed.

03:45:44
<transcript>: Yeah. I don't feel like they're right.

03:45:49
<transcript>: Console Log this is where I really enjoy.

03:45:54
<transcript>: I really enjoy the GitHub thing.

03:45:54
<transcript>: i'll pass but i turn

03:45:56
<transcript>: I'll pass, but I turned it off because it was.

03:46:01
<transcript>: New.

03:46:03
<transcript>: Okay.

03:46:09
<transcript>: New path. Okay, old pass.

03:46:09
<transcript>: public images

03:46:14
<transcript>: Public Images it'll be Xray SUG New Path Public Images hashed.

03:46:22
<transcript>: Oh.

03:46:27
<transcript>: So reader images. I need to, like, filter this or something.

03:46:33
<transcript>: Oh, yeah? So it's not inside.

03:46:36
<transcript>: So do I need to.

03:46:36
<transcript>: i

03:46:42
<transcript>: I need to delete that now. Like remove RF public images hash. Maybe.

03:46:56
<transcript>: Oh, I see. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So how would I do that? I do move. No.

03:47:01
<transcript>: Recursively.

03:47:01
<transcript>: can you

03:47:04
<transcript>: Can you move everything in a directory.

03:47:11
<transcript>: Okay, move. Public slash images.

03:47:13
<transcript>: Asterisk SVG.

03:47:13
<transcript>: to

03:47:15
<transcript>: To public.

03:47:15
<transcript>: images

03:47:17
<transcript>: Images original.

03:47:20
<transcript>: Like that.

03:47:25
<transcript>: Oh Yeah.

03:47:30
cowfacedude99: mv is recursive. cp is not.

03:47:31
<transcript>: We should be good.

03:47:35
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:47:38
<transcript>: Okay. So then here.

03:47:43
<transcript>: What is it? Base directory. Oh, yeah, here we go.

03:47:43
<transcript>: well

03:47:45
<transcript>: Well, is that gonna be.

03:47:55
<transcript>: That's where we pull them from. But then we also use Baster here. That's all. Patty. Yeah. Out here. Here. New path would not be based.

03:47:59
<transcript>: Images.

03:48:02
<transcript>: Right hashed.

03:48:06
<transcript>: That's not a work, right.

03:48:12
<transcript>: I just delete it.

03:48:15
<transcript>: Just the things I want to delete. Okay.

03:48:18
<transcript>: Again.

03:48:21
<transcript>: Whoo we did it.

03:48:25
<transcript>: I think, Yeah.

03:48:25
<transcript>: public

03:48:28
<transcript>: Public Images hashed.

03:48:28
<transcript>: looks good

03:48:30
<transcript>: Looks good to me.

03:48:32
<transcript>: Baby.

03:48:37
<transcript>: Let's reload inventory.

03:48:41
<transcript>: Like an inventory refresh. Yeah.

03:48:44
<transcript>: Oh, Geez.

03:48:44
<transcript>: didn't want to do that

03:48:45
<transcript>: Didn't want to do that.

03:48:47
<transcript>: Images.

03:48:54
<transcript>: Remove those let's quit in them.

03:49:00
<transcript>: Oh, shift are really.

03:49:00
<transcript>: nice

03:49:02
<transcript>: Nice. Okay, that refreshes.

03:49:02
<transcript>: the hash

03:49:04
<transcript>: The hashed.

03:49:04
<transcript>: original

03:49:05
<transcript>: Original.

03:49:08
<transcript>: We have a hash now.

03:49:12
<transcript>: So that should prevent some cheating.

03:49:12
<transcript>: the cheaters

03:49:27
<transcript>: The cheaters. I know you guys. You're gonna cheat moves. Recursive copy is not okay. Good to know vacation from twitching Neocrometer it's a vacation from everything. My family and I are going away for a long weekend. We'll be back on Wednesday. Next week.

03:49:33
<transcript>: Emerald CSS thank you for the follow. Appreciate that.

03:49:39
neochromer: aah have fun!

03:49:40
<transcript>: Let's actually get some more meaningful. You need to go back. Just honestly, you're not gonna offend me. I'm totally understand.

03:49:44
<transcript>: Okay. So in like 45 minutes.

03:49:44
<transcript>: like eleven your

03:49:45
<transcript>: Like Eleven. Your time. Right.

03:49:49
<transcript>: So we've got an image.

03:49:49
<transcript>: let's go back

03:49:51
<transcript>: Let's go back over here.

03:50:02
<transcript>: Still trying to like, get the vimem thing down, too. Just too much new. I should really slow down. I should probably learn one thing at a time.

03:50:02
<transcript>: yeah

03:50:05
<transcript>: Yeah an SKD.

03:50:05
<transcript>: s and

03:50:12
<transcript>: S and whatever it is, it's like your handle and Twitter. I never know what it is. I just say letters until it sounds good. Skd.

03:50:12
<transcript>: i'm kind of like

03:50:15
<transcript>: I'm kind of like I pair it with you by.

03:50:20
<transcript>: These are all Mac things to make Mac more like Linux. A guy. Three, I guess.

03:50:20
<transcript>: okay

03:50:22
<transcript>: Okay.

03:50:22
<transcript>: we have

03:50:26
<transcript>: We have this service. It needs to be bigger. It needs to be.

03:50:26
<transcript>: much bigger

03:50:27
<transcript>: Much bigger.

03:50:27
<transcript>: but it's

03:50:30
<transcript>: But it's Zoo lander thing. Much bigger.

03:50:33
<transcript>: Here we go. That looks pretty good.

03:50:44
<transcript>: So you got a service. It's not gonna be sent. Why is this sitting on the page? Oh, look at this. I was gonna say I was at such a hard time centering things vertically, and this one's, just like by default, doing it. But it's because this thing.

03:50:44
<transcript>: flex

03:50:48
<transcript>: Flex Call Item Center Just By Center.

03:50:52
<transcript>: I guess that's fine.

03:50:52
<transcript>: that's

03:50:55
<transcript>: That's just fine. So inside this Div.

03:50:58
<transcript>: I guess I don't need a Div.

03:51:02
<transcript>: Here. I could have deleted. Maybe that outer tag. I don't know. Maybe.

03:51:09
<transcript>: Should I think somebody started to say maybe I should use the next JS image element.

03:51:12
<transcript>: Should I import these Sugs.

03:51:17
<transcript>: Also, how does that still work.

03:51:22
<transcript>: Should be working because that's not a valid path anymore to an image.

03:51:25
<transcript>: There you go.

03:51:30
<transcript>: So this would be like.

03:51:30
<transcript>: original

03:51:31
<transcript>: Original.

03:51:40
<transcript>: Do I want to import them? Is this gonna be slow pulling down SVG images over the network? How big are they.

03:51:55
<transcript>: Really.

03:51:58
<transcript>: Like it still pulls them over the network.

03:52:08
<transcript>: Bites. How big are they.

03:52:10
<transcript>: How big.

03:52:10
<transcript>: just

03:52:13
<transcript>: Just kind of see it. It's just everything so small.

03:52:20
<transcript>: 243 bytes. Oh, that's fine. Resource size. Six. 4 KB.

03:52:23
<transcript>: For every Ram. So that sound bad.

03:52:27
<transcript>: I deferred your judgment back.

03:52:32
<transcript>: Each image is like six K.

03:52:40
<transcript>: That's fine to be to not like I guess if I load them all in up front to the bundle somehow.

03:52:40
<transcript>: then i'm bloating

03:52:42
cowfacedude99: that's not bad

03:52:44
<transcript>: Then I'm bloating. It by like 300 times six K. That's a lot.

03:52:49
<transcript>: Okay. So this is fine. We're just gonna let the browser cache and do its thing right.

03:52:49
<transcript>: it won't

03:52:54
<transcript>: It won't be this. It'll be the hashed. Well, let's just we started to do this right.

03:52:54
<transcript>: really

03:52:57
<transcript>: Really like to get some more meaningful before vacation.

03:53:08
<transcript>: Okay. I'd really like to get some more meaningful. I don't know if it's gonna happen or not.

03:53:08
<transcript>: so the

03:53:15
<transcript>: So the choices will look like I'm trying to model kind of fake what it's gonna look like on the back end. Choices.

03:53:19
<transcript>: Will just be strange I guess right.

03:53:22
<transcript>: So they like Amazon.

03:53:22
<transcript>: sage

03:53:24
<transcript>: Sage maker.

03:53:25
<transcript>: And.

03:53:31
<transcript>: Yeah. You're gonna get an image, and then you choose.

03:53:32
cowfacedude99: I have stuff that comes in for 2-3 mb LUL

03:53:33
<transcript>: Right. You know what I'm saying.

03:53:39
<transcript>: Yeah, multiple choice.

03:53:47
<transcript>: You have, like, type it in or anything. Amazon Cloud Watch. I don't know. I'm just trying to make something up here and then Amazon DynamoDB.

03:53:50
<transcript>: Right. These would be like our choices.

03:53:52
<transcript>: And then.

03:53:55
<transcript>: We would have a image.

03:53:55
<transcript>: which

03:53:58
<transcript>: Which will actually be the hashed thing, I guess. Right.

03:54:01
<transcript>: Our images.

03:54:06
<transcript>: Should just return the name of it not where it is. Yeah.

03:54:06
<transcript>: okay so i need

03:54:09
<transcript>: Okay. So I need to go over here, and I actually get one.

03:54:15
<transcript>: I don't know. I was able to use a random one. Doesn't matter. How do I copy the path from inventory.

03:54:15
<transcript>: is that a thing

03:54:16
<transcript>: Is that a thing.

03:54:18
<transcript>: You may know.

03:54:22
<transcript>: I feel like you can.

03:54:28
<transcript>: Oh, I can. Oh, you're saying I can literally just.

03:54:28
<transcript>: say

03:54:29
<transcript>: Say.

03:54:38
<transcript>: How can I just yank that? Oh, yeah, yeah. Look at that. Cool. The system clipboard.

03:54:46
<transcript>: So here. Can I just paste? Yes, yes, I can. Okay. So in image choices.

03:54:46
<transcript>: and then

03:54:47
<transcript>: And then what else.

03:54:55
<transcript>: Would there be.

03:54:55
<transcript>: yeah

03:54:58
<transcript>: Yeah, I guess there's should be an ID.

03:55:01
<transcript>: Like that.

03:55:11
<transcript>: And then this. So each time you answer, you get a new round back, right? Think for the follow guns. Y nine and Dane Cando.

03:55:11
<transcript>: might have missed that

03:55:14
<transcript>: Might have missed that was on break or something. I don't know.

03:55:14
<transcript>: round

03:55:16
<transcript>: Round.

03:55:16
<transcript>: then down

03:55:18
<transcript>: Then down here, we're gonna say.

03:55:20
<transcript>: Source is.

03:55:28
<transcript>: Okay, the cognitive overhead for Surround is just too much right now for me.

03:55:28
<transcript>: i just can't do it

03:55:29
<transcript>: I just can't do it.

03:55:29
<transcript>: i

03:55:31
trash_dev: Who dat

03:55:31
<transcript>: I want to do it.

03:55:35
<transcript>: Oh, really? She just don't you don't do so many things.

03:55:35
<transcript>: so

03:55:38
<transcript>: So this is gonna be.

03:55:42
<transcript>: Like you have. It simpler. Dax. You figured it out.

03:55:42
cowfacedude99: !so @trash_dev

03:55:44
<transcript>: What did I just do.

03:55:46
<transcript>: That images.

03:55:46
<transcript>: and this will be

03:55:48
<transcript>: And this will be.

03:55:48
<transcript>: has

03:55:51
<transcript>: Hash. And then this will be.

03:55:53
trash_dev: oh dats dax

03:55:54
<transcript>: No. So I could do that.

03:55:54
<transcript>: add delete

03:55:56
<transcript>: Add delete to that. Yeah. Okay.

03:56:01
<transcript>: Did what.

03:56:03
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:56:03
<transcript>: did the second time

03:56:06
<transcript>: Did the second time, the first time I did D.

<transcript>: i

03:56:08
<transcript>: I'm done.

<transcript>: What is this.

03:56:11
<transcript>: round

03:56:13
<transcript>: Round.

03:56:17
<transcript>: Image. I guess it already has the SVG right.

03:56:24
<transcript>: Oh, don't yeah I see Yeah.

03:56:28
<transcript>: So if I'm gonna go back don't tell me if I'm gonna go back.

<transcript>: Here. I feel like I used to get, like, autocomplete Tags. Here.

03:58:53
<transcript>: This Div is going to be let's see.

03:58:57
<transcript>: It's gonna be class name.

03:59:00

<transcript>: Like I put items, center and SpaceX on everything.

03:59:09
<transcript>: we're gonna

03:59:15
<transcript>: We're gonna make buttons, so there's gonna be a list of buttons for each answer, right.

03:59:15
<transcript>: so we're gonna

03:59:17
<transcript>: So we're gonna do.

03:59:18
<transcript>: Round.

03:59:18
<transcript>: choice

03:59:22
<transcript>: Choices map.

03:59:24
<transcript>: Okay.

03:59:30
<transcript>: And we're gonna do a button.

03:59:33
<transcript>: He is going to be choice.

03:59:35
<transcript>: Id.

03:59:37
<transcript>: Do what.

03:59:41
<transcript>: String with choices. Just a bit of strings.

03:59:41
<transcript>: oh the

03:59:48
<transcript>: Oh, the Ram? Oh, yeah? Each of these is gonna need? Oh, it can just be it could just be the value? The key can just be the value? Yeah.

03:59:48
<transcript>: yeah

03:59:49
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:59:49
<transcript>: okay

03:59:52
<transcript>: Okay. And then the text of this button.

03:59:52
niftynate80: @trash_dev polyester gave me zits

04:00:03
<transcript>: Is going to also, why do I not get those surrounded, those automatic ending Tags anymore? Did I delete something that was that LC Saga? Did I get Rails pizzaga? And that's what was doing it for me.

04:00:06
<transcript>: Choice.

04:00:06
<transcript>: okay

04:00:11
<transcript>: Okay. So we showed some buttons. Yeah, yeah. And we got to make that look nice.

04:00:15
niftynate80: My skin said I can’t breath

04:00:16
trash_dev: 👀👀

04:00:16
<transcript>: Click a default button. Styling.

04:00:16
<transcript>: we kind of

04:00:20
<transcript>: We kind of make it make them. What's that style? Where it's like.

04:00:20
<transcript>: it's intentionally

04:00:24
<transcript>: It's intentionally done looking. What's that called? You know I'm talking about.

04:00:27
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow Camilo.

04:00:27
<transcript>: it's

04:00:28
niftynate80: I thought it was cotton!

04:00:29
<transcript>: It's like there's a word for it.

04:00:29
<transcript>: and it's

04:00:31
<transcript>: And it's like very like.

04:00:31
<transcript>: contrast

04:00:36
trash_dev: brute

04:00:42
<transcript>: Contrasty and like squared off and thick lines. And it just looks dumb. Like it looks like you don't want to make it UI. You just need something, but not like just default. You know what I'm saying.

04:00:43
alan__rice: brutalist?

04:00:43
<transcript>: Anybody.

04:00:48
karrbs: I know what you are talking about but I forget the name

04:00:49
trash_dev: ^

04:00:49
<transcript>: Brute. Brutalist. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Both of you.

04:00:49
<transcript>: yeah

04:00:51
<transcript>: Yeah, brutalist.

04:00:51
<transcript>: tailwind

04:00:52
neochromer: Wireframe?

04:00:54
<transcript>: Tailwind. I don't know. That's gonna be a thing.

04:00:58
<transcript>: Brutalist WebKit.

04:01:00
alan__rice: https://brutalistwebsites.com/

04:01:02
<transcript>: I want to brutalist button.

04:01:02
<transcript>: tailwind style

04:01:03
<transcript>: Tailwind style.

04:01:07
<transcript>: So I'm gonna do tailwind.

04:01:07
<transcript>: brutal

04:01:09
<transcript>: Brutalist.

04:01:21
<transcript>: Style button. I guess you just look at the normal CSS I'm translated to telling, I guess.

04:01:21
<transcript>: what is brut

04:01:26
schrew: they make websites with concrete poured onsite these days? LUL

04:01:31
<transcript>: What is brutalist butt. And look like that's not a brutal spot. That's a brutalist, but kind of kind of. But like, I feel like that's not. There we go. Now. We're talking. That's what I want. Okay.

04:01:37
<transcript>: Looks pretty good, right? I know. But it's kind of like it's its own thing, you know? It's its own style.

04:01:37
<transcript>: brutality

04:01:38
<transcript>: Brutality.

04:01:38
<transcript>: com

04:01:40
<transcript>: Com. Okay, nice.

04:01:41
karrbs: honestly just make a square and give it a bright color

04:01:48
karrbs: rectangle*

04:01:56
<transcript>: Cool. So I want my button to look like that. So we're gonna say we're gonna translate this to tail end. So it's got an after that's gonna get a little complicated. But what's the beginning part? So the background color, white. Is that default? I need to save background white.

04:02:00
<transcript>: Border, border, border.

04:02:00
<transcript>: two

04:02:01
<transcript>: Two.

04:02:04
<transcript>: Border, green.

04:02:07
<transcript>: Work on Colors later.

04:02:09
<transcript>: Green.

04:02:12
<transcript>: Padding. That's some big padding, I guess.

04:02:17
<transcript>: If so, padding five. Oh, so the X is five.

04:02:21
<transcript>: The Y or not, the Y would be five.

04:02:24
<transcript>: And the PX would be the.

04:02:24
<transcript>: fifty so

04:02:25
<transcript>: 50 so.

04:02:28
<transcript>: Twelveish.

04:02:30
<transcript>: Font weight is bold.

04:02:33
<transcript>: Size.

04:02:35
<transcript>: Text.

04:02:35
<transcript>: thirty

04:02:37
<transcript>: 30 pixels? What's the closest.

04:02:44
<transcript>: 24, 28 would be seven. Text, seven. Right.

04:02:44
<transcript>: alright

04:02:46
<transcript>: Alright.

04:02:46
<transcript>: now

04:02:48
<transcript>: Now I made that up.

04:02:50
<transcript>: I don't know what I'm talking about. That's 72.

04:02:54
<transcript>: What I think, what was Five XLB.

04:02:59
<transcript>: 48. I'm trying to get to 50 now I'm trying to get 30.

04:03:02
<transcript>: Three XL.

04:03:06
nexxeln: text-xl or 2xl should be fine

04:03:06
<transcript>: 30. That's right. Okay, cool.

04:03:06
<transcript>: first

04:03:08
<transcript>: First try.

04:03:14
<transcript>: What's that look like? Did we get a start? Okay. Looks awful.

04:03:18
<transcript>: Looks awful, but like the picture kind of.

04:03:22
<transcript>: Okay, let's do this. Needs to have.

04:03:22
<transcript>: some

04:03:23
nillhiam: you can this text-[30px]

04:03:23
<transcript>: Some.

04:03:30
<transcript>: Space, wide.

04:03:30
<transcript>: or something

04:03:32
<transcript>: Or something.

04:03:35
<transcript>: More than that five, six.

04:03:38
<transcript>: Okay.

04:03:44
<transcript>: Still looks bad, but we're making progress. It's ten. Can you do ten.

04:03:55
<transcript>: What else is bad? Everything is bad. Does that border to.

04:03:57
<transcript>: That.

04:04:03
<transcript>: And then you're gonna add, this is gonna make the difference. It's the shadow.

04:04:06
<transcript>: You can't just do that with like a shadow or something.

04:04:06
<transcript>: i

04:04:16
<transcript>: I can this text 30 pixels. Oh, yeah. Good call Nilham. Welcome to Chat. Nilham. Could have just used an arbitrary value there. That's a good call.

04:04:19
<transcript>: Make a square and give it a bright color.

04:04:26
<transcript>: That's basically brutalist, isn't it? So we gotta use an after. Can't just do this with a shadow.

04:04:26
<transcript>: i think

04:04:29
<transcript>: I think you can do after right.

04:04:29
<transcript>: after

04:04:30
<transcript>: After.

04:04:32
<transcript>: What's? That.

04:04:35
niftynate80: @trash_dev I ordered the elgato wave 3

04:04:39
<transcript>: That's what I'm saying. Can you design a shadow that looks just like that? Dax with CSS. Do you think.

04:04:43
<transcript>: Okay.

04:04:43
karrbs: 0px shadow radius

04:04:45
karrbs: something like that

04:04:46
<transcript>: Content? How do you do that.

04:04:46
<transcript>: is it like

04:04:47
<transcript>: Is it like.

04:04:47
<transcript>: now

04:04:48
<transcript>: Now.

04:04:48
<transcript>: that's terrible

04:04:50
<transcript>: That's terrible.

04:04:50
<transcript>: anyone

04:04:56
niftynate80: El gato the cat

04:04:56
<transcript>: Anyone know how you do content of an after I can do all the other things after absolute.

04:04:56
<transcript>: after

04:04:58
<transcript>: After.

04:05:01
<transcript>: Background Green 500.

04:05:03
<transcript>: After.

04:05:05
<transcript>: Top.

04:05:08
<transcript>: Eight pixels would be two.

04:05:08
<transcript>: right

04:05:10
<transcript>: Right.

04:05:10
niftynate80: @trash_dev what mic do you use ?

04:05:13
<transcript>: Yeah.

04:05:15
<transcript>: After.

04:05:18
<transcript>: Left, two.

04:05:23
<transcript>: At Simon. I might make me a pro tail end course.

04:05:25
<transcript>: After.

04:05:25
<transcript>: right

04:05:27
<transcript>: Right is minus.

04:05:27
<transcript>: after

04:05:29
<transcript>: After wait.

04:05:29
<transcript>: what am i doing

04:05:31
<transcript>: What am I doing? Left to.

04:05:31
<transcript>: the right

04:05:34
<transcript>: The right, left to gas right after.

04:05:45
karrbs: can you not make a class in tailwind

04:05:45
<transcript>: People like put them all on different lines or something. Is that the cool way to do tail end.

04:05:49
<transcript>: Probably.

04:05:49
<transcript>: let's see

04:05:52
<transcript>: Let's see. No, this is it.

04:05:54
<transcript>: Deal with it.

04:05:56
<transcript>: After.

04:05:56
<transcript>: the

04:05:59
<transcript>: The index minus one.

04:05:59
<transcript>: say

04:06:00
nexxeln: i just to text wrap in my editor

04:06:04
<transcript>: Say Right. I did new bottom minus bottom two. And then after.

04:06:06
<transcript>: See.

04:06:10
<transcript>: Minus Z ten.

04:06:15
<transcript>: How we doing here? We just don't have contents on it. Oh Geez.

04:06:17
cowfacedude99: 80 char police LUL

04:06:20
<transcript>: That's awesome. I need to do after content. So let's do this tailwind.

04:06:20
<transcript>: after

04:06:21
alan__rice: add more css to the button

04:06:21
<transcript>: After.

04:06:21
<transcript>: content

04:06:24
<transcript>: Content? I don't know. How do I do the content of it.

04:06:29
<transcript>: I'll put none. Does that make it? No.

04:06:33
<transcript>: Kind of do an arbitrary value. Yeah. Here we go. Content.

04:06:36
<transcript>: What kind of space.

04:06:36
<transcript>: before

04:06:37
<transcript>: Before content.

04:06:37
<transcript>: attribute

04:06:41
<transcript>: Attribute attribute before what's that do? Oh, spaces. Here we go.

04:06:48
<transcript>: Some firespace and at the end of a class an HTML replacing spaces in archery with an underscore.

04:06:48
<transcript>: so if

04:06:50
<transcript>: So if I do.

04:06:52
<transcript>: After.

04:06:56
<transcript>: Han tune.

04:07:01
nillhiam: after:content-['content-value']

04:07:01
<transcript>: This is gonna work. Do we need to do a pole? It'll lose axe.

04:07:05
<transcript>: It did not work.

04:07:10
<transcript>: Content value in Quotes. Somebody says.

04:07:12
<transcript>: Content value.

04:07:12
<transcript>: so

04:07:14
<transcript>: So.

04:07:15
karrbs: I think tailwind has a theme where you can make classes

04:07:19
<transcript>: You really don't use anything, do you.

04:07:23
<transcript>: Act. You're just use some stuff. Okay. So you do use some stuff.

04:07:28
zebbath: button lacks relative

04:07:34
karrbs: Dax is like pure css

04:07:35
<transcript>: Yes, that would be super fun. There we go. We did it.

04:07:38
<transcript>: We did it.

04:07:39
karrbs: nothing else

04:07:43
<transcript>: This line is only like I don't know.

04:07:43
<transcript>: how many characters

04:07:44
<transcript>: How many characters.

04:07:44
<transcript>: let's go to the end

04:07:45
<transcript>: Let's go to the end.

04:07:48
nexxeln: nicee

04:07:50
fragaverage: drop-shadow-[raw css stuff]

04:07:51
<transcript>: It doesn't no tailwind classes just generally do this.

04:07:51
<transcript>: i mean i could

04:08:01
<transcript>: I mean, I could use what I could do is use like class names. Let's do that. Let's do that. I'm gonna do empm. Install class name.

04:08:05
<transcript>: Show you how I would do it next.

04:08:11
<transcript>: Of course it does.

04:08:14
<transcript>: I do want to see.

04:08:14
<transcript>: yours built

04:08:15
<transcript>: Yours built.

04:08:15
<transcript>: i want to see

04:08:18
<transcript>: I want to see your stack. The DAX stack.

04:08:18
<transcript>: this is to be fair

04:08:21
<transcript>: This is to be fair. This isn't my stack. It's the T three stack.

04:08:21
<transcript>: and

04:08:26
fragaverage: doesnt prettier's print width fix that?

04:08:26
nexxeln: i use clsx

04:08:35
nillhiam: @FragAverage i think there is also shadow-[]

04:08:41
<transcript>: And I do use tailwind, but there's probably better ways to do every single thing you see on this stream today. I am learning for the first time. So forgive T three and everyone else involved. I mean, forgive CEO and forgive his community. This is probably the worst way to use T three stack. Just things I do will be bad. Okay, so now I could do this.

04:08:47
fragaverage: @Nillhiam that's a box shadow

04:08:48
<transcript>: Oh, it did it, it auto, did it. Do you see that.

04:08:48
<transcript>: so

04:08:50
<transcript>: So 220 characters.

04:08:56
backkflipp: Reported from wrong usage of T3.

04:08:56
<transcript>: Thing so class name is auto believe that one.

04:08:56
<transcript>: it did

04:08:57
<transcript>: It did.

04:08:57
<transcript>: feels good

04:08:59
<transcript>: Feels good.

04:08:59
<transcript>: class name and

04:09:00
<transcript>: Class name. And then we're gonna say.

04:09:00
<transcript>: this thing

04:09:04
backkflipp: *for ...

04:09:08
<transcript>: This thing is true so I can just separate them. They're all gonna be true. There's nothing conditional about this. I guess there might be an.

04:09:13
<transcript>: Click on one. It turns like red with a big X on it or something. I don't know.

04:09:13
<transcript>: that fine so

04:09:21
<transcript>: That fine. So bad that the default whatever font you get just by default in your browser. Look how bad it is. Makes me sad.

04:09:21
<transcript>: we're

04:09:23
<transcript>: We're gonna do.

04:09:23
<transcript>: bracket

04:09:25
<transcript>: Bracket. And then we're gonna go.

04:09:25
<transcript>: f close

04:09:26
nexxeln: lol

04:09:32
<transcript>: F close bracket. Oh, it did try to do something here, but it's freaking out, okay, because I just need to add.

04:09:32
<transcript>: true

04:09:33
<transcript>: True.

04:09:33
<transcript>: so i can do that

04:09:35
backkflipp: Btw, hello everyone!

04:09:37
<transcript>: So I can do that. And then I can start breaking it up. Right.

04:09:38
<transcript>: So.

04:09:43
<transcript>: I want to, like, duplicate this whole thing, but now I wish it didn't wrap.

04:09:46
<transcript>: Yank.

04:09:51
<transcript>: Oh, disgusting.

04:09:53
cowfacedude99: macros

04:09:54
<transcript>: It's not gonna let me do that. I'm gonna have to delete a bunch of these.

04:09:59
<transcript>: Delete all of that.

04:10:02
<transcript>: I.

04:10:08
<transcript>: 'm no, I don't want to do that. I want to delete the other. I want to delete from here.

04:10:14
<transcript>: We'll just do all the after stuff here, right? Yeah.

04:10:14
<transcript>: so

04:10:16
<transcript>: So delete.

04:10:16
<transcript>: now all of

04:10:20
<transcript>: Now all of our after stuff is on this line and I can go.

04:10:24
<transcript>: Yeah. So then I can do, like delete.

04:10:25
<transcript>: To quote.

04:10:25
<transcript>: okay

04:10:32
<transcript>: Okay. So that's a way it doesn't look all that much better. But like now, at least our AfterSTEP is all on a separate.

04:10:32
<transcript>: i don't know you could

04:10:37
<transcript>: I don't know. You could go as far as you want with that. This conditional is just a way to say, like.

04:10:43
<transcript>: You can have dynamic ways that classes are added or removed right based on state.

04:10:46
<transcript>: Okay.

04:10:49
<transcript>: Looking pretty terrible.

04:10:49
<transcript>: are we proud

04:10:53
<transcript>: Are we proud of this? We should make the button width, constant.

04:10:58
<transcript>: We should do more space between them. We should make them smaller. Because.

04:10:58
<transcript>: they're

04:10:58
<transcript>: They're.

04:10:58
<transcript>: giant

04:11:00
<transcript>: Giant.

04:11:08

04:11:09
<transcript>: Oh, David, David would just he would just cry right now if you saw this roller.

04:11:11
<transcript>: He's not dead.

04:11:14
<transcript>: See. Maintain.

04:11:26
<transcript>: What I want to do. I wanted to instead of space lying. This. I was dumb. I was just overdoing it, you know, sometimes you just overdo it. We're just gonna do a margin. Top margin, top.

04:11:30
karrbs: brutalist dark mode is high contrast karrbsSip

04:11:31
<transcript>: I don't know arbitrary value? No, that's that's less.

04:11:34
<transcript>: Okay.

04:11:34
<transcript>: let's make the

04:11:37
<transcript>: Let's make the button six width.

04:11:37
<transcript>: on a

04:11:39
<transcript>: On a new thing here.

04:11:39
<transcript>: width

04:11:40
<transcript>: Width.

04:11:43
<transcript>: 64.

04:11:47
<transcript>: I don't know if it's gonna be way too much.

04:11:47
<transcript>: oh

04:11:49
<transcript>: Oh, looks pretty good.

04:11:49
<transcript>: the font

04:11:51
<transcript>: The font size is bad.

04:11:51
<transcript>: do we have

04:11:56
<transcript>: Do we have a text? Three XL. Yeah, that's too big.

04:11:57
<transcript>: X.

04:12:01
<transcript>: xl

04:12:02
<transcript>: Xl.

04:12:05
<transcript>: Oh, the height needs to be constant as well.

04:12:11
<transcript>: Hi.

04:12:13
<transcript>: To the what.

04:12:22
<transcript>: 's that.

04:12:22
<transcript>: oh just

04:12:26
<transcript>: Oh, justify straight. I'll have a good idea. Yeah, I like that better.

04:12:36
<transcript>: And then it's well, then they'll change based on if like all of them are lower, if all of them are on one line, then it'll change back and forth. I wanted to probably say coffee Casta. Right.

04:12:38
<transcript>: Okay.

04:12:38
<transcript>: look at this

04:12:40
<transcript>: Look at this. Look at this.

04:12:40
<transcript>: brutalist

04:12:43
<transcript>: Brutalist dark mode is high contrast.

04:12:46

<transcript>: Yeah. So it's like when you don't have to like, do generics at the user level. Like, I don't have to start specifying types. It just infers everything.

04:16:25
<transcript>: that's

04:16:28
<transcript>: That's when you do okay.

04:16:32
<transcript>: You and Alex. Close to you. Like, talk with Alex.

04:16:33
backkflipp: 3 year old creates OS - all other devs are discarded.....

04:16:37
<transcript>: Yeah.

04:16:42
karrbs: I really need to get into the deep of TS

04:16:43
<transcript>: Okay. What time to come on my stream. It's all.

04:16:43
<transcript>: he

04:16:46
<transcript>: He said he will someday.

04:16:46
<transcript>: that doesn't sound promise

04:16:48
<transcript>: That doesn't sound promiseing. So.

04:16:57
<transcript>: I talked to Alex way before TrpC kind of blew up, and now I feel like I'm just, like, kind of like, hey, remember me? And it just feels bad.

04:17:00
<transcript>: I want to delete this whole thing. How do I do that.

04:17:00
<transcript>: that dp

04:17:02
<transcript>: That DP.

04:17:06
<transcript>: Yeah. Dap. Okay.

04:17:11
<transcript>: So what do we what do we do here? We. Oh, I was looking at matte.

04:17:13
<transcript>: Feeling more bad about my technology choices.

04:17:13
<transcript>: you

04:17:24
<transcript>: You use like the Arch Linux of Airything. It's like I feel like Macaroon is like the Arts Linux, like it's just it's like Nish it's early. I don't know if Art just knew, but.

04:17:32
<transcript>: Okay, the type crypt. Illuminati. Exactly. There's like this whole club. But DAX has going and they're all under 20.

04:17:32
<transcript>: and

04:17:34
<transcript>: And they're his minions.

04:17:37
<transcript>: Okay. So what.

04:17:43
<transcript>: Yeah. You're just, like making sure it's all getting done. You're not doing it. You're just getting it done.

04:17:43
<transcript>: alright

04:17:46
<transcript>: Alright. We got like ten more minutes a day.

04:17:46
<transcript>: and then

04:17:51
<transcript>: And then DAX is gonna leave, and we're just gonna probably like, Wallow in our style.

04:17:54
sergioquijano: Arch is old, cool kids now use NixOS

04:17:57
<transcript>: There's a whole I got to see this hole. Where is it.

04:17:57
<transcript>: i can see it

04:18:00
<transcript>: I can see it in this video. Oh, right there. What is that hole from.

04:18:04
<transcript>: I.

04:18:04
<transcript>: igno

04:18:06
<transcript>: Igno.

04:18:09
karrbs: Stop throwing controllers lol

04:18:11
<transcript>: ignore

04:18:14
<transcript>: Ignore do you think you bumped it or something or just.

04:18:23
<transcript>: Oh, Wow.

04:18:27
<transcript>: Oh, really? Did I know this.

04:18:29
<transcript>: You're moved to Miami.

04:18:32
<transcript>: I saw that on Twitter.

04:18:43
<transcript>: Are you gonna be involved? Are you gonna, like, hold the Trowel or something for this contractor.

04:18:47
<transcript>: You're just gonna step out of the way. You're not handy like that, right.

04:18:47
<transcript>: okay

04:18:49
<transcript>: Okay. Good. I could.

04:19:06
alan__rice: i remember you putting a hammer through your ceiling

04:19:11
<transcript>: Yeah. My wife tries to get me to do handy stuff, and like, she's finally kind of giving up like, this just not me. I'm just never gonna be good at anything. That's not it a computer. I'm not good at computer stuff either, but I'm at least comfortable. I like sitting in the chair when I try to build things with my hands, it just goes poorly.

04:19:19
<transcript>: Sergio said Arch is old, cool kids now use NixOS. What about Pop OS? I've seen that making the rounds.

04:19:20
<transcript>: Oh.

04:19:26
<transcript>: I don't even know what that means is that I actually possible.

04:19:29
<transcript>: Okay.

04:19:33
<transcript>: So while you're here.

04:19:33
<transcript>: go ahead

04:19:34
<transcript>: Go ahead.

04:19:36
cowfacedude99: pop is noob stuff.

04:19:38
<transcript>: Nick OS.

04:19:47
<transcript>: Oh, Pop, y pop making the rounds just as soon as I was, like, getting excited about maybe trying out Arch or Arc or whatever.

04:19:47
<transcript>: then i

04:19:47
karrbs: <--- noob here

04:19:49
karrbs: lol

04:19:49
sergioquijano: Isn't pop os based on ubuntu?

04:19:50
<transcript>: Then I see everybody's popping stuff.

04:19:53
cowfacedude99: pop is based of ubuntu

04:19:54
<transcript>: Oh, really? Okay.

04:20:00
<transcript>: Interesting. Okay, that's enough about Linux. Distros.

04:20:00
<transcript>: i'm trying

04:20:04
<transcript>: I'm trying to run the latest Mac OS and look at all the problems I've had.

04:20:05
karrbs: @SergioQuijano yes but they are slowly seperating

04:20:08
<transcript>: All that.

04:20:08
<transcript>: oh

04:20:11
<transcript>: Oh, but it is kind of is that what you're saying.

04:20:11
karrbs: separating *

04:20:12
cowfacedude99: system76 ships pop

04:20:25
<transcript>: What system? 76. I've seen that as a little cafe. I saw that somewhere.

04:20:32
<transcript>: Okay.

04:20:38
neochromer: yeah

04:20:39
<transcript>: Laptops. I'm on the laptop. In one time, I just. I only work when I'm at my desk. I've given up on being productive.

04:20:41
<transcript>: Are you okay? Cool.

04:20:44
karrbs: They make desktops as well

04:20:44
<transcript>: I'm cool. Then there's five.

04:20:44
<transcript>: yeah exactly

04:20:45
<transcript>: Yeah, exactly.

04:20:51
neochromer: Framwork vs System76 go

04:20:54
<transcript>: Okay. I want to actually make this real, so I want to, like, get round. We're gonna create these from the back end in ten minutes. If we have ten minutes.

04:21:01
<transcript>: I thought we could do a lot more.

04:21:03
neochromer: I also have a laptop but I use my Desktop for everything

04:21:05
<transcript>: What is my guess? Mean.

04:21:12
<transcript>: Yeah, that would have happened. We wouldn't. I mean, we still. We could have still. And we haven't gotten there.

04:21:12
<transcript>: to the point

04:21:20
neochromer: I don't even know where my Laptop is.. but I got a steamdeck now

04:21:21
neochromer: which is nice

04:21:22
<transcript>: To the point where we would need to install it or whatever. So this is just game rider. Let's see. This is new mutation. So now let's do a so you have a game.

04:21:25
karrbs: @NeoChromer framework if you want to support the mission.. System 76 but < HP Dev One

04:21:27
<transcript>: Each game has round. I guess I have to persist these to the database right.

04:21:27
<transcript>: because

04:21:34
<transcript>: Because like there's no shared stage, there's no running server. So like when I create a round, go ahead.

04:21:39
<transcript>: Act. The response.

04:21:56
<transcript>: Yeah, because the server determines when there's a new round.

04:21:56
<transcript>: well it's

04:22:01
<transcript>: Well, it's a new round whenever you successfully guess where the time runs out, I guess.

04:22:07
<transcript>: I'm making up the rules. I did ever say anything about there being a time limit on a given answer. I just made that up.

04:22:12
<transcript>: So you're saying, like, do this get state.

04:22:17
<transcript>: Okay.

04:22:27
<transcript>: There's no input, right.

04:22:31
<transcript>: Like this would just be pulling it empty. Yeah.

04:22:38
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. That would make sense. So input.

04:22:38
<transcript>: z

04:22:40
<transcript>: Z dot object.

04:22:44
<transcript>: Game ID. I guess.

04:22:44
<transcript>: see that

04:22:45
<transcript>: See that string.

04:22:48
<transcript>: Min one.

04:22:51
<transcript>: There's that done.

04:22:51
<transcript>: like a better

04:22:54
<transcript>: Like a better is there a better tight for like an ID.

04:22:56
<transcript>: Nah.

04:23:01
cowfacedude99: to be fair, I was on ubuntu for 4 years (I had built stuff off of ubuntu server iso though)

04:23:04
<transcript>: Okay.

04:23:14
<transcript>: So this is resolving. We've got a game ID.

04:23:14
<transcript>: so

04:23:15
<transcript>: So.

04:23:21
<transcript>: And then we're gonna say what we're gonna say.

04:23:30
<transcript>: Return. So we have to have, like, more than I guess we're just returning the game, but we have to add stuff to it.

04:23:37
<transcript>: Like, Am I just doing Prisma? That game is like a Find. What is it? Find first.

04:23:40
<transcript>: Get forget.

04:23:44
<transcript>: Find first. Wait. Do you not use Prisma? I forget.

04:23:44
<transcript>: forget you

04:23:46
<transcript>: Forget you don't use these. Yeah.

04:23:46
<transcript>: right

04:23:48
<transcript>: Right. Okay.

04:23:48
<transcript>: game

04:23:52
<transcript>: Game. Fine. First, I'm guessing this is gonna be like.

04:23:52
cowfacedude99: i moved to nix about a month ago

04:23:55
<transcript>: This. Maybe. Yeah.

04:24:01
<transcript>: If I could have.

04:24:08
<transcript>: Ip any boolean is no properties in common with reject. Okay, so it's like an object.

04:24:08
<transcript>: select

04:24:10
<transcript>: Select what.

04:24:10
<transcript>: oh

04:24:15
<transcript>: Oh, it's oh, yeah, it's like this is a sequel database I'm working with here.

04:24:18
<transcript>: Feels bad.

04:24:22
<transcript>: I want to delete.

04:24:27
<transcript>: To that.

04:24:27
<transcript>: what

04:24:28
alan__rice: "i use kysely [smug]" .. dax y u have to be better than everybody?! lol hipster hacker!

04:24:29
<transcript>: What.

04:24:39
<transcript>: The Ram information. Are we gonna store it in the database.

04:24:49
<transcript>: Yeah, I guess it would be its own model. So you're saying what now you're saying? Just return.

04:24:52
<transcript>: Like create a new.

04:25:01
<transcript>: I gotcha but the problem is like, when would we so we're polling. We're getting the current round. The new round would change over whenever they answer.

04:25:01
<transcript>: right so we need

04:25:03
<transcript>: Right. So we need like an answer mutation as well.

04:25:07
<transcript>: Delete.

04:25:07
<transcript>: to

04:25:08
<transcript>: To.

04:25:13
<transcript>: Find first.

04:25:24
<transcript>: Select no. It'd be where I guess this is so weird. I'm writing sequel. I guess kind of is this how people would do it? I thought there'd just be like a callback thing.

04:25:35
<transcript>: Like where I could just like like a Lambda function style. Like an arrow function where I'm like the one where it looks like this. Is that now how prison works. I actually define a where clause like this.

04:25:35
fragaverage: prisma is fun LUL

04:25:39
<transcript>: Yeah.

04:25:39
<transcript>: okay

04:25:44
<transcript>: Okay here where and then provide filter here. So.

04:25:47
<transcript>: You're saying, though, I don't need to do this. Is that what you're saying.

04:25:54
<transcript>: But I don't need to do that.

04:25:54
<transcript>: oh yeah

04:25:57
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, yeah. You're saying I'm not gonna actually store.

04:25:57
<transcript>: the round

04:25:59
<transcript>: The Round Information on this.

04:25:59
<transcript>: so

04:26:01
<transcript>: So I'm.

04:26:09
<transcript>: Just going to return the round of fake round I guess the problem is I want to stop doing sake stuff. So this real thing I would do here is.

04:26:16
<transcript>: I would have to know if they've actually answered because we're gonna be pulling just constantly, right for the game. State.

04:26:16
<transcript>: that's what we decided

04:26:17
<transcript>: That's what we decided.

04:26:25
<transcript>: And I would have to know if they've moved on to a new round or not to create a new round. Otherwise, just return the previous round. Right. And we'd store those.

04:26:46
<transcript>: Yeah.

04:26:52
<transcript>: I want to do the actually the answer mutation. Does that make sense to you.

04:26:55
<transcript>: I think I want to do it first, because I think.

04:26:55
<transcript>: it's gonna help me think

04:27:00
<transcript>: It's gonna help me think about this whole thing. So input Z, dot, object.

04:27:02
<transcript>: We're gonna do a.

04:27:06
<transcript>: Guess I have to have a round ID.

04:27:09
<transcript>: Is this all bad to do in the game, right.

04:27:11
<transcript>: righter

04:27:12
<transcript>: Righter.

04:27:24
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. Okay. So just the game ID.

04:27:28
<transcript>: Yeah.

04:27:38
<transcript>: Min one is how I say like it has to be provided there's not a more semantic way of saying like required or something.

04:27:44
<transcript>: Okay.

04:27:52
<transcript>: Okay, so game ID Z string than one, and then they have to pass the choice, I guess.

04:27:52
<transcript>: which will

04:27:54
<transcript>: Which will be.

04:27:57
<transcript>: Do I want to pass the index.

04:27:57
<transcript>: don't want to pass

04:27:58
<transcript>: Don't want to pass.

04:28:03
<transcript>: The ID of the value.

04:28:07
<transcript>: Either way, it's gonna be something like this.

04:28:13
<transcript>: Okay. And then I. Yeah, looks great.

04:28:13
<transcript>: great

04:28:14
fragaverage: and the round number?

04:28:15
<transcript>: Great, he says.

04:28:19
fragaverage: assuming game = multiple rounds?

04:28:19
<transcript>: Context input.

04:28:21
<transcript>: Back him over.

04:28:21
<transcript>: knacks and

04:28:28
<transcript>: Knacks and enjoy some watching contractors do work for me. That sounds more fun than what I'm gonna be done after you leave.

04:28:30
<transcript>: Resolve.

04:28:30
<transcript>: oh i forgot

04:28:31
<transcript>: Oh, I forgot.

04:28:33
<transcript>: No.

04:28:33
<transcript>: that

04:28:35
<transcript>: That.

04:28:38
<transcript>: What's wrong here.

04:28:38
<transcript>: this

04:28:39
<transcript>: This. That I haven't.

04:28:39
<transcript>: returned

04:28:41
<transcript>: Returned? Anything.

04:28:43
<transcript>: This.

04:28:46
<transcript>: Oh Yeah.

04:29:03
<transcript>: Yeah, so.

04:29:03
<transcript>: let's be honest

04:29:04
<transcript>: Let's be honest.

04:29:06
<transcript>: Yeah. There's a lot of cases.

04:29:10
<transcript>: I'm gonna need, like a new schema.

04:29:13
<transcript>: Entry. Right.

04:29:13
<transcript>: yeah

04:29:15
<transcript>: Yeah.

04:29:15
<transcript>: it's kind

04:29:18
<transcript>: It's kind of like related to game right game has rounds.

04:29:26
<transcript>: Yeah.

04:29:29
<transcript>: Default COID.

04:29:37
<transcript>: And then the round does have a name. But the round is basically what we just modeled earlier, right? Had a answer.

04:29:40
<transcript>: Which is a string.

04:29:40
<transcript>: we're gonna store

04:29:43
<transcript>: We're gonna store the hash as the answer is that the idea.

04:29:51
<transcript>: Okay. Let's do a string.

04:29:58
<transcript>: Is that not with the Cu ideas? Oh, you're saying I should be a number.

04:30:02
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow. Neil Does nothing.

04:30:07
<transcript>: Yeah, game is multiple rounds. Frag. That's right.

04:30:16
<transcript>: So answer and then choices. I mean.

04:30:19
<transcript>: Choices.

04:30:22
<transcript>: Is like an array of something.

04:30:25
<transcript>: Array of strings.

04:30:33
<transcript>: And I'm just gonna do them like that, like the friendly printed version, because I'm gonna derive that from the fire names, I guess.

04:30:36
<transcript>: Wait a minute.

04:30:41
<transcript>: No, I'm gonna have to actually have like what's that.

04:30:41
<transcript>: yeah map

04:30:45
<transcript>: Yeah. Map. Yeah. On the back end that can get all that stuff.

04:30:48
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay. Well.

04:30:51
<transcript>: Yeah.

04:30:55
<transcript>: So yeah, string.

04:30:55
<transcript>: like that

04:30:58
<transcript>: Like that. And then there the the related.

04:31:01
<transcript>: Here we have game.

04:31:01
<transcript>: maybe

04:31:03
<transcript>: Maybe a game.

04:31:06
<transcript>: Relation.

04:31:08
<transcript>: Fields.

04:31:12
<transcript>: Name ID. I'll have to add.

04:31:16
<transcript>: Right? I don't know. I'm making this up.

04:31:16
<transcript>: in my my

04:31:18
<transcript>: In my my on it.

04:31:20
<transcript>: Maybe.

04:31:20
<transcript>: preferences

04:31:24
<transcript>: Preferences. Id. I'm kind of I'm graphing. What they're doing here.

04:31:24
<transcript>: on delet

04:31:26
<transcript>: On delete.

04:31:26
<transcript>: cascades

04:31:31
<transcript>: Cascades. So if you delete the game, you should delete all the rounds. Yeah, that sounds right.

04:31:35
<transcript>: Oh really.

04:31:44
<transcript>: Oh, right, well, it won't do the cascade that you're saying it all still, I know it just won't work.

04:31:52
<transcript>: Yeah.

04:31:55
<transcript>: Well.

04:31:55
<transcript>: it's

04:32:04
<transcript>: It's time, it's time. I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna transition over here, and it's gonna be broken. Dax is gonna be on, but I'm gonna bring him back.

04:32:09
<transcript>: There he is. Next. Thank you so much. I know you've got things to do.

04:32:13
<transcript>: He's been very helpful. You helped me Dodge.

04:32:13
<transcript>: what you

04:32:21
<transcript>: What you didn't. You said it's really good the replicas thing, but maybe not great for this use case. So.

04:32:21
<transcript>: we're just gonna build it

04:32:26
<transcript>: We're just gonna build it the other way. We're gonna lean into the TRPC thing.

04:32:38
<transcript>: Okay. Next time you come back, things will be better. We'll have the guest thing sorted out. I'll do it offstream even so, I don't put my audience through that torture of work on my own overlays a bunch more.

04:32:43
<transcript>: Yeah, always good to have you on X the two times I've had you on.

04:32:43
<transcript>: cool

04:32:45
<transcript>: Cool.

04:32:50
<transcript>: You build it with your stack.

04:33:02
<transcript>: Yeah, we've thought through the actual I mean, I still were making up the whole game as we go. So that'll be nice to settled it.

04:33:02
<transcript>: cool

04:33:03
<transcript>: Cool.

04:33:06
<transcript>: Maybe.

04:33:06
<transcript>: this one looks

04:33:10
<transcript>: This one looks like it's gonna be about six streams with this piece.

04:33:12
<transcript>: I'm sorry to everyone.

04:33:23
schrew: Good strm! Good to see ya dax!

04:33:29
<transcript>: Oh, nice. Yes. We'll do your screen while you do all these cool things. And it's gonna be great. Cool. Thanks so much, Stax. I don't know how to send you off when I'm still streaming. Actually, you know what? Maybe I'll just be done. I'll just be done. Yeah, good. Stream. It's been good.

04:33:37
<transcript>: I just kind of don't. I just kind of want to end it and go on vacation. So thank you, everybody, for showing up. Thank you, DAX. We're gonna call it.

04:33:37
<transcript>: that's great

04:33:39
<transcript>: That's great. Maybe we can do again sometime.

04:33:42
alan__rice: see ya

04:33:49
<transcript>: I think I effectively. We're sending everybody to study time. See, it acts.

04:33:49
