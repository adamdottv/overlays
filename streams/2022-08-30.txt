kylliangamer: Adam is here?!

10:25:34
oleksii_lisovyi: Heyo!

10:26:35
oleksii_lisovyi: I was wondering if that part of the screen could be removed from the current scene.

10:26:41
monciego: hello adamm adamel4DealWithIt

10:27:12
jaystation3x: "Sleep begets sleep" — quote from some baby book I remember from first newborn, 15 years ago.

10:27:29
oleksii_lisovyi: There is a screen on the right side. It's blurred, but still bothers me.

10:28:02
kylliangamer: I found this on reddit yesterday, pretty funny: https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/k0u6ig/my_crotch_goblin_realized_today_that_he_can_climb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3

10:28:04
stroopwafel26: it's a nice screen

10:28:26
oleksii_lisovyi: It's not a big deal, some kind of "improvement", so don't mind much :)

10:28:32
jaystation3x: On stream today — lens shopping.

10:28:46
cedpoilly: Hello everyone 👋

10:29:00
kylliangamer: the "crotch goblin" is his child, dw

10:29:04
godbless_27: Hello

10:29:14
renatompf: Hey there @adamelmore how are you today?

10:29:30
stroopwafel26: an actual todo list?!

10:29:33
cedpoilly: ced"pwa""lee" 😊

10:29:39
renatompf: Good as well... Working

10:29:46
matty_twoshoes: oh that one was mine!!!!!

10:29:55
oleksii_lisovyi: Are you doing that with SolidJS Kappa ?

10:29:57
matty_twoshoes: mattyt25Love

10:30:11
oleksii_lisovyi: You know, some SOLID development.

10:30:52
monciego: will you check astro? i'm currently learning it

10:30:52
stroopwafel26: I always create todo lists but then end up not doing anything from the todo list until I can't ignore it anymore MaxLOL

10:31:09
kylliangamer: Astro?

10:31:13
oleksii_lisovyi: BTW does any one in here using password manager? I used to use LastPass, but with the latest issue I'm about to move somewhere else. I'm considering 1Password, any comments on this one or any others?

10:31:33
daeeyy: https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim?

10:31:35
wahlstra: https://astro.build

10:31:47
stroopwafel26: @oleksii_lisovyi 1password has been solid for me for many years

10:32:19
megadriving: bitwardens the best. open source and free.

10:32:19
cedpoilly: thanks Adam. that was the French pronunciation. so technically you can now speak French 😆

10:32:44
megadriving: thanks joshWave

10:32:46
andom: @oleksii_lisovyi are you talking about last pass randomly adding values to fields?

10:32:57
keithgnx: +1 for bitwarden

10:33:02
stroopwafel26: co-driving stream sounds like a great idea, just a case of getting that multi-camera green screen setup in a car

10:33:08
oleksii_lisovyi: @adamelmore here it's: https://blog.lastpass.com/2022/08/notice-of-recent-security-incident/  You should also get an email – I've got the one.

10:33:08
jenswoeste: Hey Adam, hey chat!

10:33:22
keithgnx: Hello 👋🏼

10:33:22
kylliangamer: so astro is a nextjs replacement?

10:33:31
cedpoilly: @megadriving is the username a reference to the Mega Drive device?

10:33:40
oleksii_lisovyi: @oleksii_lisovyi Thanks

10:33:52
monciego: replacement for gatsby?

10:34:08
oleksii_lisovyi: @Andom Nope, security issue. The link is above ^

10:34:26
cedpoilly: Astro is like: static sites + some minor reactivity

10:34:29
megadriving: @cedpoilly yep

10:34:52
oleksii_lisovyi: Hot take 🔥

10:35:00
cedpoilly: any thoughts on Astro + custom elements for interactivity?

10:35:01
stroopwafel26: Hot Take Tuesday

10:35:45
kylliangamer: I like how the baby is still on the screen during these hot takes

10:36:26
cedpoilly: @adamelmore https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements

10:37:25

10:37:46
homiecoder: heyo @adamelmore! sup chat peeps!

10:37:48
godbless_27: Kid is going places

10:38:02
kylliangamer: he's tearing the place apart

10:38:47
stroopwafel26: let me add another award to this post

10:38:52
oleksii_lisovyi: Lovely taehaHeart

10:38:59
cedpoilly: yeah I wanted full Web components some years ago. Never really became a reality. Not all standards were implement by evergreens last time I checked (I might be outdated)

10:39:33
oleksii_lisovyi: Just be better Kappa

10:39:37
stroopwafel26: - [ ] rant about twitter

10:40:12
kylliangamer: Everyone on Reddit hates everyone, it's not you, dw.

10:41:06
kylliangamer: There's this meme that sums Reddit up pretty nice: Person A: "I hate myself" Person B: "here join Reddit" Person A: "wow I hate everyone else so much more!"

10:41:20
stroopwafel26: oh yeah i have an anger management lifehack to share: I put my car in chill mode so it says "chill" in the left-hand corner of the screen all the time as a reminder to myself

10:41:30
oleksii_lisovyi: @KyllianGamer LUL

10:41:30
stroopwafel26: follow me for more lifehacks

10:42:58
oleksii_lisovyi: Already retired Kappa ?

10:43:59
homiecoder: @stroopwafel26 boss status! real boss don't trip til he has to. homiecoder = proudhomie

10:44:24
matty_twoshoes: unfortunately no

10:44:37
adamelmore: adamel4Fuzzy

10:44:41
matty_twoshoes: stop stream > start stream, delete previous vod

10:44:49
oleksii_lisovyi: I envy now so badly 😭

10:44:51
stroopwafel26: adamel4DealWithIt

10:44:53
matty_twoshoes: only 30 mins

10:45:05
matty_twoshoes: mostly baby video

10:45:10
matty_twoshoes: yep.

10:45:21
matty_twoshoes: in vscode i use an extension.

10:45:22
daeeyy: ppy streams with about a 20 second delay. Think it's so he can kill the stream for this kind of thing.

10:45:27
laytanl_: Hey all!

10:45:31
mjewl: time to script a secret rotator?

10:45:35
kylliangamer: (Twitch Suggestions at: /UserVoice) "Cut out specific parts of VOD": One of my biggest DMCA concerns is having to delete an entire VOD because of a few minutes of music. Is Twitch working on a way to cut out specific parts of VODs so that we don't have to sacrifice the entire stream? [Votes: 254]

10:46:15
matty_twoshoes: @KyllianGamer Twitch has ZERO interest in improving vods or clips. All features that they release or develop recently are around streaming.

10:46:43
homiecoder: wait do all u guys stream?

10:46:54
homiecoder: is this a chatters stream?

10:47:13
matty_twoshoes: @daeeyy oh yeah, forgot about that

10:47:14
kylliangamer: @Matty_TwoShoes I don't think Twitch has ANY interest in listening to their community at all tbh. Most of the time when I see a good idea like that on their UserVoice it has a bunch of upvotes, it's 2+ years old, it's not implemented and has no official reaction.

10:47:26
laytanl_: :Telescope buffers

10:47:43
matty_twoshoes: @KyllianGamer yep.

10:48:02
jenswoeste: hi @Matty_TwoShoes!

10:48:03
mjewl: I've streamed like twice primeagenHeyy

10:48:11
matty_twoshoes: @JensWoeste HypeWave

10:49:02
stroopwafel26: - [ ] rotate all secrets (again)

10:49:18
matty_twoshoes: so you do know that that blurring the text is also not secure, right? it can be decoded from the video.

10:49:18
laytanl_: You should create a neovim plugin that automatically fuzzies when you open a .env file, seems like a cool project

10:49:26
parkour_peter: Hello!

10:50:05
matty_twoshoes: https://www.hackread.com/underactor-tool-reveal-pixelated-text-expose-data/

10:50:08
matty_twoshoes: 100%.

10:50:20
matty_twoshoes: i had a discussion with the author of the tool on twitter.

10:50:37
parkour_peter: CSI: Miami tech

10:50:37
matty_twoshoes: it's on Github: https://github.com/bishopfox/unredacter

10:50:50
laytanl_: The amount of pixelation you have is probably secure

10:50:58
uberrick: Hey Adam

10:51:00
kylliangamer: plus adam uses a custom font in most stuff

10:51:05
stroopwafel26: @laytanl_ this, it doesn't even look like anything anymore

10:51:08
matty_twoshoes: The author says that NO amount of pixelation is secure.

10:51:10
uberrick: Yeah I think it's unlikely you can as the blocks are so big

10:51:23
jenswoeste: we could test it? screenshot a blurrred image and see if we can reverse it? LETSGOOO!

10:51:30
daeeyy: If it just puts random pixels where there is writing, it should be sequre

10:52:08
wahlstra: max amount of pixelation is 1 pixel for the whole screen. seems hard to reverse

10:52:24
cowfacedude99: !today

10:52:24
fossabot: Building a Twitch overlay in Next.JS

10:52:38
stroopwafel26: hey @cowfacedude99 \o/

10:52:51
cowfacedude99: hi @stroopwafel26

10:53:03
matty_twoshoes: "The bottom line is that when you need to redact text, use black bars covering the whole text. Never use anything else. No pixelization, no blurring, no fuzzing, no swirling. "

10:53:44
matty_twoshoes: on my stream and many others who deal with code, we've just started hiding the desktop completely.

10:53:50
matty_twoshoes: okay yeah, smth like this works.

10:53:51
jaystation3x: And black bars must be burned in. So many stories of bad redaction.

10:54:10
daeeyy: yeah black bars over pdf text lol

10:54:12
kylliangamer: time to decode EZ Clap

10:54:13
matty_twoshoes: this is kind of neat though

10:54:22
stroopwafel26: It's like you're in Minecraft

10:54:41
cowfacedude99: wait. did someone break your keys?

10:54:45
oleksii_lisovyi: Clipped!

10:54:53
uberrick: decoded it now, you've got OBS open

10:55:06
matty_twoshoes: LUL

10:55:19
stroopwafel26: MaxLOL

10:56:42
homiecoder: saw a vscode ext "cloak" it hashes the values in your env file looks like ansible vault

10:57:18
jaystation3x: Download vod, delete vod, edit out secrets, play back vod through OBS as a new stream. Good chat would be replaced with confused chat, though.

10:57:23
matty_twoshoes: I mean the process for harvesting a secret is: 1) go into VOD, find timestamp of secrets shown 2) enlarge the image enough 3) carefully type out the  keys for the service you want 4) actually do something nefarious

10:57:24
cowfacedude99: that happens a lot.

10:57:24
homiecoder: i guess that kinda matters haha

10:57:28
oleksii_lisovyi: https://clips.twitch.tv/OnerousCrypticTruffleBabyRage-19Lwg5GC-0Lb5vr3

10:57:47
matty_twoshoes: you CAN upload the VOD to twitch again as a video, if you want.

10:57:54
stroopwafel26: @jaystation3x chat is always confused

10:58:24
matty_twoshoes: (after cutting out the bit)

10:58:37
cowfacedude99: prime leaked his credit card last year(or the year before)

10:58:47
matty_twoshoes: it's true, it happens a LOT on twitch and i have yet to know of a case where it ended up that someone actually used the secrets or whatever stuff

10:59:01
oleksii_lisovyi: Don't forget to pixel that all!

10:59:03
matty_twoshoes: tech space on twitch is a nice little sanctum :)

10:59:19
matty_twoshoes: you should blur this

10:59:23
homiecoder: hide screen

10:59:24
jaystation3x: "Twitch is easy"

10:59:26
stroopwafel26: adamel4Fuzzy

10:59:32
matty_twoshoes: adamel4Fuzzy

11:00:08
oleksii_lisovyi: adamel4Fuzzy

11:00:35
sirtimme: imo all secret stuff should be locked behind a "click to reveal" (like the website should implement it like this)

11:00:39
uberrick: The only issue with listening to music is I'm currently using your Spotify

11:00:40
jaystation3x: Yesterday I got a captcha of cats and the instructions were "Click each image containing a cat with large, rounded head."

11:00:42
kylliangamer: I just decoded that there was something on the screen. The decoder doesn't know what it was, but it knows there was something! I'm getting close!

11:01:10
uberrick: @jaystation3x that is definitely specific

11:01:13
oleksii_lisovyi: Somebody's first time watching stream: oh, so much of the pixel art!

11:01:38
daeeyy: Wondering if you can capture the keyboard keystrokes using the click audio.

11:01:56
matty_twoshoes: I think you should implement a consent banner via Twitch Extension so we have to accept to watch your "real" stream content.

11:02:12
matty_twoshoes: @daeeyy yes, it's been done too. Project is on GitHub.

11:02:34
matty_twoshoes: https://github.com/ggerganov/kbd-audio

11:02:34
kylliangamer: How would you possibly tell the difference between two keys from audio?

11:02:42
matty_twoshoes: No idea, but it works.

11:03:03
daeeyy: different pitch, different time between clicks, since some keys are hit with same finger?

11:03:05
matty_twoshoes: Even with a crappy mic from a mobile phone

00:50:11
lukeyfam15: Hey

00:50:31
keithgnx: I doubt Adam is typing in secrets manually anyway. Now try and hack copy/paste.

00:50:57
lukeyfam15: What we doing?

00:50:59
jaystation3x: Time to update the video description.

00:51:58
uberrick: @jaystation3x never! neovim and twitch overlays for life

00:52:33
neochromer: Hello hello and good mornign

00:53:42
matty_twoshoes: would have been worse if someone had spent 1M to bring out adamel4Animadam

00:55:21
neochromer: test test

00:55:32
neochromer: woo its working, hello from my terminal

00:55:51
neochromer: I assume I won't be able to see the emoticons but can't have it all

00:56:56
neochromer: yeah, there is a IRC client WeChat, can be configured to use twitch with it.. and looks nice, can also join multiple streamers chats

00:57:40
matty_twoshoes: btw to get to 1M earned points the fastest, even on Tier 3 sub with many raids etc. you're still looking at around 400 hours of watchtime

00:58:23
matty_twoshoes: that's 50-60 streams easily, so this isn't likely to happen anytime soon. you've got time.

01:04:25
corfliss: Hello there.

01:06:16
sirtimme: Positivity syncrosFlower syncrosWiggle

01:06:44
kylliangamer: Question: how are account specific actions (with http requests) on websites authenticated after the initial login? Does the login return like a session ID or isn't that how it works?

01:08:13
daeeyy: why are some words on your todo list red underlined?

01:09:36
kylliangamer: Interesting, thank you adam.

01:13:34
neochromer: on the topic of JWT

01:13:40
neochromer: how do you guys invalidate JWTs?

01:13:46
neochromer: do you blacklist it or something?

01:14:54
carlosgn: yep

01:19:43
danielgerep: I'm here because of this: https://twitter.com/adamdotdev/status/1564557381467623425

01:20:04
danielgerep: Not anymore!

01:20:37
stroopwafel26: meetings about setting up more meetings to talk about other stuff MaxLOL

01:20:56
danielgerep: Meta meetings, right? hahaha the worse kind!

01:21:06
stroopwafel26: so meta

01:22:42
kylliangamer: late nights in the middle of july

01:23:11
carlosgn: are you happy with neovim?

01:23:48
matty_twoshoes: @KyllianGamer late nights in the middle of juuuuuuuuune

01:24:53
stroopwafel26: and having neovim in your stream title gained you about a 1000 followers :P

01:25:52
stroopwafel26: all neovim

01:28:32
<transcript>: 

01:28:51

<transcript>: 

01:28:38
<transcript>: so start i'm gonna go back here actually and not

01:30:46
danielgerep: When you have some time, maybe you can add your Github link to the channel description =)

01:30:58
stroopwafel26: !github

01:30:58
fossabot: Adam's neovim config lives here: https://github.com/adamelmore/nvim

01:32:48
danielgerep: Why is there a link to Ozark in the description?

01:33:37
danielgerep: hahahaha

01:38:59
stroopwafel26: does :noh work? or is that not a neovim thing?

01:39:12
kylliangamer: NotLikeThis

01:39:50
stroopwafel26: clears search highlights

01:39:57
cowfacedude99: no search highlights

01:40:04
stroopwafel26: i have it mapped to <esc><esc>

01:40:31
stroopwafel26: but i'm an oldskool vim user, no neovim for me

01:40:49
cowfacedude99: @stroopwafel26 I have it on space space

01:41:04
stroopwafel26: also a good one

01:41:30
stroopwafel26: I tried vim-ing on a macbook without a physical esc key the other day MaxLOL

01:42:01
stroopwafel26: "wait, did i hit escape? i did... i think"

01:43:05
nutlesssquirrel: Can'

01:43:23
nutlesssquirrel: Can't remeber off the top off my head but cntrl+[ or ] is an escape alternative

01:43:29
nutlesssquirrel: I like hitting enter before I send a message

01:44:31
nutlesssquirrel: wait no... before I finish a message. This brain's not working tonight.

01:46:13
stroopwafel26: some people map escape to caps lock but I never liked doing that

01:47:31
cowfacedude99: @stroopwafel26 I am one of those. I have caps and esc swapped, so that caps is there when I need it.

01:47:32
nutlesssquirrel: Yeah that would bug me. I can't stand having the caps light on.

01:47:53
stroopwafel26: lol same @NutlessSquirrel

01:48:11
stroopwafel26: anyway, just use a keyboard with an actual escape key :P

01:49:03
nutlesssquirrel: Use no keybaord and do it all via voice-to-text commands

01:49:21
cowfacedude99: You won't be able to vim then LUL

rowenwillabus: didn't check in for a few days and look at chu; flying through nvim as I said. 🐐

02:02:38
stroopwafel26: Open back headphones are not great when you find yourself in an open office space

02:02:46
athano: I guess you just get more isolation with closed versus open (where you'd just be hearing everything around you as normal)

02:02:50
mmmint: what do you use to render that?

02:03:13
beardage: every time I need headphones I go look at headfi dot org, they're the OG audio dudes

02:03:26
athano: thanks for the advice guys!

02:03:36
kylliangamer: It's not math, it's meth

02:03:36
matty_twoshoes: what i did is absolutely not math

02:03:37
mmmint: but is it divs, canvas or svg?

02:03:43
stroopwafel26: I use AirPods Max right now as I cannot do any work without noise cancellation.

02:04:14
mmmint: how's the performance? I would go for canvas for performance

02:04:23
athano: I had bought the Sony XM4 about a month ago but got really bad ache on the top of my head, so I'm returning them

02:04:28
purrplish: head-fi is a rabbit hole. Trust me

02:04:34
purrplish: LUL

02:05:08
stroopwafel26: @Athano I had that as well but with the Bose 700s, AirPods Max don't hurt in any way luckily

02:05:11
kylliangamer: It's not complicated math though, it's just distance formulas mainly, like that one on screen right now is just distance from center

02:05:23
athano: @Athano great to hear!

02:05:50
stroopwafel26: yeah corded headphones are better for streaming longer periods of time

02:06:11
homiecoder: ty u all going to sleep nitr all

02:06:23
stroopwafel26: gn @HomieCoder

02:07:15
wardcast_: what colour scheme are you using?

02:07:32
cowfacedude99: didn't you say that you had it covered with meson?

02:07:46
cowfacedude99: check your null ls config

02:08:09
stroopwafel26: autostart is set to false?

02:08:10
kylliangamer: late nights in the middle of juuuuuwnn

02:08:37
stroopwafel26: @WardCast_ Dracula, more in FAQ below the stream :)

02:08:46
wardcast_: all right thanks

02:09:21
athano: depends on your eslint config though

02:09:28
athano: your rules

02:10:10
cowfacedude99: I guess it will be in node_modules/.bin/eslint_d

02:10:31
cowfacedude99: if it is not available outside

02:11:06
cowfacedude99: drop into the terminal.

02:11:08
cowfacedude99: LUL

02:11:18
beardage: Shift I

02:11:23
beardage: I believe

02:11:49
theliverr: Is that your own vim config or some predefined one?

02:12:08
cowfacedude99: it should be eslint filename

02:12:27
beardage: shift I should show hidden files in nvim tree

02:13:25
fragaverage: suuuuure

02:13:28
stroopwafel26: we did it chat

02:16:32
cowfacedude99: This is why I prefer to install all my node stuff via volta.

02:17:21
cowfacedude99: volta list is much neater than running through dependency hell with npm/yarn global

02:17:50
stroopwafel26: is that kinda like pipenv but for node?

02:18:01
cowfacedude99: sort of.

02:18:07
stroopwafel26: cool

02:18:39
cowfacedude99: but it saves everything in package.json which is a pain while working on projects

02:20:12
cowfacedude99: https://docs.volta.sh/guide/ for anyone interested

02:20:39
stroopwafel26: gonna try it out for the occasional aws cdk project i do

02:20:43
christoph0saurus: how did you get eslint working inside your nvim? I was only half paying attention. (sorry)

02:23:02
christoph0saurus: ah gotcha gotcha. Thanks

02:24:44

02:48:17
laytanl_: Hey Adam, I just created a neovim plugin that replaces your secrets in .env files with stars, want the link?

02:49:46
stroopwafel26: Today is a day like that, I haven't gotten ANYTHING working and it's driving me nuts

02:50:21
stroopwafel26: Gotta rename myself to AdamBot

02:50:23
laytanl_: https://github.com/laytan/cloak.nvim here it is

02:50:26
matty_twoshoes: today is that day for me too adam, dw

02:50:28
schrew: yesterday was one of those days... still haven't gotten the tests to pass today :(

02:50:50
stroopwafel26: @laytanl_ that's really awesome

02:51:35
stroopwafel26: a README and a .gif!

02:51:48
laytanl_: Haha it was actually pretty easy with all the neovim niceties

02:51:50
stroopwafel26: @laytanl_ is the real deal

02:51:59
laytanl_: Hope it works lol

02:53:56
laytanl_: Please test while you are in fuzzy

02:54:01
laytanl_: before it doesn't work

02:54:07
laytanl_: I would feel ba

02:54:28
ogjake: Cloak.lua not .nvim

02:56:34
laytanl_: No it's virtual text

02:56:55
laytanl_: Like lsp diagnostics but it's overlayed instead of at the end

02:56:57
caldotjs: same thing as the LSP information

02:57:06
caldotjs: oh. @laytanl_ beat me to it

02:58:00
lordmunta: hi o/

02:58:03
laytanl_: Haha thanks!

02:58:19
stroopwafel26: the code is super clean too

02:58:25
stroopwafel26: love it

02:58:32
caldotjs: imagine he implemented something that the virtual text isn't shown every nth time :>

02:58:40
stroopwafel26: lol

02:59:07
matty_twoshoes: oh adam, you're so naïve...you will still most definitely leak secrets again LUL

02:59:47
laytanl_: I also wanted to do this in the telescope preview but couldn't figure it out, so be carefull with that

02:59:49
absenth762: Now I want this for pair programming on Zoom. :)

03:00:18
caldotjs: don't forget to star his repo kids

03:00:27
jakobthesoftwareengineer: Hey man first watching your stream and enjoy it a lot! But I have a question, do you have any experience using Vim for Java development? (starting my first full time job out off uni in 2 weeks and they are a java shop)

03:00:28
stroopwafel26: @caldotjs way ahead of you

03:01:29
schrew: i use vim plugin for intellij for java development because I'm a pleb

03:01:30
stroopwafel26: Java should be written in IntelliJ change my mind

03:01:31
caldotjs: I heard that the JetBrains stuff is hard to beat on Java Dev

03:01:41
caldotjs: @stroopwafel26 ^ this

03:01:43
schrew: consensus reached, LUL

03:01:49
lampel_: IntelliJ is much better for java then vim

03:02:38
stroopwafel26: maybe another adamel4Adambar will solve all of your issues

03:04:01
absenth762: introducing me to cloak.nvim alone is worthy of a follow.  :)

03:06:27
cowfacedude99: (another 30 min later)... everything is working!!!! why is it working?????

03:09:13
stream_kyle: Fun fact: Today is Frankenstein Day

03:09:17
kylliangamer: hey I'm back, did you fix the transcribing?

03:09:22
cowfacedude99: TIE.....

03:09:46
kylliangamer: "Should I press on"?

03:09:58
stream_kyle: Frankenstein Day is apparently just Mary Shelley's birthday.

03:10:22
kylliangamer: they're making you continue to suffer?

03:12:36
stroopwafel26: oh hey @laytanl_ is Dutch

03:14:29
laytanl_: Yeah I am!

03:15:04
laytanl_: I could guess that someone named 'stroopwafel' is Dutch lol

03:15:36
kylliangamer: I'm from the Dutch part of Belgium

03:15:36
stroopwafel26: @laytanl_ it's true

03:19:30
markboots__: Hey guys, late today. What are we up too?

03:19:43

kylliangamer: @MarkBoots__ Suffering

03:20:22
caldotjs: DDOSing the assemlby ai api

03:20:35
markboots__: evil chat

03:20:39
stroopwafel26: @MarkBoots__ full on agony

03:21:29
kylliangamer: Lol sometimes your key logger doesn't log in the right order, just now you typed "much" and it logged "mcuh"

03:21:39
caldotjs: is there an option to only show the keystrokes when a specific app is in focus? would be good to only show it for the console

03:22:11
schrew: Nah, it logged it correctly. You deleted thrice and then retyped "uch"

03:22:42
markboots__: adamel4DealWithIt adamel4Fuzzy they got through too. yeay

03:23:27
danielgerep: I thought the bad hair would be added, not replace, sorry.

03:27:47
privann: Helllo

03:28:22
charliec97: looks like an OBS issue :/

03:28:57
charliec97: Ohhh, I see

03:29:08
privann: Just had a really fun bug. So I am building banking integrations. And we send a lot of data. and today I had a bug where the sessions was terminated as the bank wanted me to add 2 digits and required it. So sending 5 (as 5 $) was not ok, the banked wanted me to send (5.00 $).

03:29:19
kylliangamer: @adamelmore also I think I'm going to change my animations so they are timed differently so it's no longer a perfect (like a timeout period of it being blank) otherwise I'm never gonna be able to perfectly time them

03:29:19
privann: If I would get a error code would everything work :)

03:29:21
privann: but noop

03:29:33
kylliangamer: a perfect loop*

03:29:35
neochromer: why do you have HEX as console logs

03:33:16
laytanl_: F

03:33:27
nullchefo: F

03:33:34
stroopwafel26: he back

03:33:37
schrew: @KyllianGamer I noticed that with some of your transitions, thought it was a neat way to "seed" the animations, but you're right it does interfere with timing

03:33:44
stroopwafel26: no audio

03:34:10
pat_kot: cant hear u

03:34:11
laytanl_: Yep can't hear you

pat_kot: send us a tutorial on lip reading

03:34:43
schrew: when we needed transcription the most, he disappeared

03:34:59
privann: oh wait is this a sign language session

03:35:23
laytanl_: He doesn't believe us lol

03:35:29

adamelmore: obs shows bars moving

adamelmore: going to restart again

03:36:12
adamelmore: fml

03:36:14
laytanl_: This is too funny

03:36:14
stroopwafel26: you should just git reset HEAD at this point :D

03:36:22
danielgerep: Restart everything =) The best solution.

03:36:27
markboots__: "Did you try switching of and on again"

03:36:29
pat_kot: @stroopwafel26 --hard LOL

03:36:36
pat_kot: NotLikeThis

schrew: https://clips.twitch.tv/create

03:37:44
adamelmore: too painful

03:37:46
stroopwafel26: is it not the audio router app?

03:37:51
pat_kot: I love these new age streams without audio

03:37:55
adamelmore: obs says it's getting audio

03:37:59
pat_kot: Where one can use his own music and imagine the conversations

03:38:01
laytanl_: So peacefull

03:38:03
noobita_xd: ahahaha

03:38:06
adamelmore: going to git revert and enjoy my day lol

03:38:08
