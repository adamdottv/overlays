veidar45: Hi Adam, how are you feeling neovim compared to vscode?

14:09:14
caldotjs: I am getting out_of_memoried.. :( at least both of our brains are struggling rn :D

dirtdriv3r: That's such a clean setup

14:15:30
caldotjs: wait. you need "b0o/schemastore.nvim" it gives you access to all those (https://www.schemastore.org/json/) schemas. you can plug it into "jsonls" and use it with LSP

14:15:50
levifig: Overdoing production quality is tight!

14:15:55
levifig: ;)

14:16:21
stroopwafel26: overdoing anything is good

14:16:34
stroopwafel26: except drugs, don't do drugs

14:16:44
levifig: @stroopwafel26 well, that took a turn :P

14:17:06
stroopwafel26: how the turn tables

14:17:58

14:24:21
schrew: ya can't just put three k's in a row in twitch chat

14:24:33

14:28:08

14:30:10
levifig: don't compare yourself with Prime tho :P

14:30:34
caldotjs: @levifig & lua *_*

14:30:40
levifig: the guy is insane with his keyboard mojo

14:30:49
morbidmiyako: is there a reason to use neovim over using for instance VScode with vim keybindings?

14:30:58
levifig: yup, that's basically Primeagen

14:31:03
brunobmello25: prime has a really good video on horizontal navigation using f,F,t and T, and I use a plugin called quickscope that really helps visualizing those keymaps better

14:31:18
levifig: VSCode with Vim keybinding is painful

14:31:26
levifig: I use that a bit

14:31:37
brunobmello25: PDE - Personalized Developer Environment

14:31:49
levifig: and I'm the most comfortable with Vim keybindings and when trying to use VSC with them it's annoying

14:31:58
grasp5533: Are you using neovim outside stream as well?

14:31:58
levifig: yeah, that teej's video was good

14:32:09
ajukraine: PDE, personal development environment

14:32:56
morbidmiyako: hmm might invest some time to set up sth like neovim or spacemacs sometime

14:32:59
morbidmiyako: thx

14:33:05
teej_dv: yeah, pde is pretty good term Kappa

14:33:14
ajukraine: ooff, tj's jere

14:33:16
ajukraine: *here

14:33:28
teej_dv: that's my term, yayayaya

14:33:35
levifig: great job on that video btw, @teej_dv üëè

14:33:41
teej_dv: thanks @levifig

14:34:11
teej_dv: easier to just refresh

14:34:13
teej_dv: LUL

14:34:32
levifig: doesn't it show on 1k increments now?

14:34:44
ajukraine: i guess, it's "t j" not "teej" @teej_dv ?

14:34:44
teej_dv: yeah, i'd guess it's more like "eventually consistent sub count"

14:34:51
teej_dv: @ajukraine either is good

14:35:28
teej_dv: i would just refresh when it's close and record it on twitch LUL

14:35:30
caldotjs: yeah, I mean clicking on random links is never something bad, so why not

14:37:15
levifig: this is the typical programming meme: "No idea why it's working. I have no idea why it's working."

14:38:30
jenswoeste: you are only setting text if text is defined. Since its undefined it never gets set?

14:41:00
markboots__: so, just as a recap. The text comes in, you check if the timestamp is different from the previous timestamp. If so, log it. Then allways write the new to previous

14:41:55
schrew: YEAH BABY

14:43:43
<transcript>: 

14:44:52
<transcript>: current text i don't know i'm just kind of different things at this point i'm just guessing

14:45:21
<transcript>: If current text.

brunobmello25: my moonlander just arrived :D

14:46:07
caldotjs: @brunobmello25 we need a review. contemplating to order it since a while

14:46:13
brunobmello25: been waiting for them for 2 months hehe

14:46:30
caldotjs: but the advantage360 also looks nice

14:46:42
brunobmello25: I ordered them and had them ship to spain because my cousin was there, now he came to brazil and brought it to me

14:46:52
brunobmello25: cheaper than paying import taxes

14:47:17
andom: Waiting for dygma defy to come out in december and will buy those then

14:48:02
caldotjs: @Andom also looks nice! why would you take it over the advantage/moonlander

14:48:42
andom: mostly becuase it has the possibility to tilt the keyboard for more natural hand position

14:52:10
schrew: *cries in angular*

14:54:06
<transcript>: this and let's log previous transcript

14:59:53
