00:13:28
stroopwafel26: What's up with that huge cup? I did not that get the reference

00:13:30
<transcript>: It's like a. It's like a Twitch thing. I don't know. Binja.

<transcript>: You know Binja Sorry, his his Twitch handle is.

00:13:34

00:13:36
<transcript>: A car.

00:13:36
<transcript>: a car

00:13:37
<transcript>: A car.

00:13:37
<transcript>: yeah nobody

00:13:39
<transcript>: Yeah, nobody got the reference.

00:13:39
<transcript>: a car

00:13:43
madlep: twitchers drink from huge doggie bowls. It's a thing

00:13:45
<transcript>: A car Binja. He's a streamer. He works at Space drive.

00:13:53
<transcript>: And he he like started this whole drinking from huge bowls thing. I don't know him in some Prince.

00:13:53
<transcript>: did it

00:14:02
<transcript>: Did it. It just kind of made the rounds. I just. It's like happened like five days ago. It's probably not even a thing anymore, but I haven't streamed for five days, so I've got to do it now. Just the thing.

00:14:04
fragaverage: I've been away for like 8 days, and the world has changed

00:14:05
stroopwafel26: Now you have a huge bowl

00:14:07
<transcript>: Okay. To my plans. I'm only streaming. I updated my schedule. I'm only streaming.

00:14:07
<transcript>: two two days

00:14:13
<transcript>: Two, two days a week now, Tuesdays and Thursdays. I don't know if I can do that.

00:14:21
<transcript>: I guess so. Why am I doing only two days a week? I would stream five days a week. I would stream.

00:14:21
<transcript>: ten

00:14:22
stroopwafel26: where do you even store a bowl of that size

00:14:28
<transcript>: 10 hours a day, five days a week. My wife would leave me. But I love it like I love this. It's my favorite.

00:14:28
<transcript>: but

00:14:31
<transcript>: But I do need to.

00:14:31
<transcript>: spend some focus

00:14:34
<transcript>: Spend some focus time on stuff that I don't think.

00:14:34
<transcript>: you would enjoy

00:14:45
<transcript>: You would enjoy watching on Stream and let me talk about what that is. So I finally decided what I want to be when I grow up. I know. I've talked about that in the past. Like, what is it I want to do with my time.

00:14:46
cedpoilly: hello all!

00:14:48
<transcript>: I don't want to do client work anymore.

00:14:48
<transcript>: and i think

00:14:52
<transcript>: And I think I could even do client work on Stream. Probably.

00:14:52
<transcript>: but i really

00:14:58
<transcript>: But I really just. I don't I don't want to do it. I want to kind of like, do something else.

00:14:58
<transcript>: it's just

00:15:00
<transcript>: It's just very unfulfilling.

00:15:00
<transcript>: the

00:15:10
<transcript>: The thing about client work, it just you're helping one person, you know, like you're going off in a corner. And even if it let me share stuff I'm working on publicly, it's like you're helping one.

00:15:10
<transcript>: business

00:15:18
<transcript>: Business owner situation ultimately like even the employees like it doesn't help them I don't know is really like helping one individual.

00:15:18
<transcript>: or

00:15:22
<transcript>: Or set of individuals that own this thing you're helping make better.

00:15:22
<transcript>: and

00:15:25
<transcript>: And that just feels very, I don't know.

00:15:25
<transcript>: limited

00:15:26
<transcript>: Limited.

00:15:26
<transcript>: just feel

00:15:30
<transcript>: Just feels like, is that how I want to spend my time just as a mercenary.

00:15:30
<transcript>: like

00:15:35
<transcript>: Like for hire out improving people's hey, said Polly.

00:15:35
<transcript>: and

00:15:40
<transcript>: And improving individual startup owners or whatever situation.

00:15:40
<transcript>: it just doesn't

00:16:00
<transcript>: It just doesn't doesn't do it for me. So I spent a lot of time. I found it high thinking through what is it I want to really do, like what does fulfill me. And I think it's teaching. I think I've probably said this on stream that I wanted to be like a College Professor when I was a kid. I don't know why it's a sort of a random things aspire to, but I did always think.

00:16:00
<transcript>: like

00:16:06
madlep: superbowl

00:16:13
<transcript>: Like teaching was in my future. I think it's something I could enjoy at this stage of my career. Whatever I can impart on people who are getting started in this career, I'm energized by spending time with people who are new to this stuff.

00:16:15
stroopwafel26: which superb owl?

00:16:19
<transcript>: And I think streaming all so kind of helped me see that this could be something I really enjoy.

00:16:26
<transcript>: So I'm gonna, like, go all in towards that goal. I want to find a way.

00:16:26
<transcript>: to never

00:16:30
<transcript>: To never do consulting again, and to just somehow.

00:16:42
<transcript>: Earn an income as a teacher, and that I don't know. That feels like kind of cringey. Like I don't. I hate it even announcing that I was working on a course because.

00:16:42
<transcript>: okay

00:16:45
kittih11: Hey hey.

00:16:47
cedpoilly: Teaching one-on-one is fulfilling @adamdotdev. But not scalable

00:16:47
<transcript>: Okay. Now I have this on my face so this can be a little less serious, but that's okay.

00:16:53
<transcript>: I don't know. There's just like this thing about like.

00:16:57
<transcript>: Tech education tech courses.

00:16:57
<transcript>: monetizing

00:16:59
<transcript>: Monetizing. That stuff.

00:16:59
<transcript>: it just feels

00:17:06
<transcript>: It just feels real bad, right? Hey, hey, Kitty, Kitty, kiddie. Welcome to Chap. First time chatter.

00:17:18
<transcript>: Yo teaching oneonone is fulfilling binaska. But yeah, I want to do like if I were just teaching one person that wouldn't also probably have the same problems with just doing consulting. It's like.

00:17:18
<transcript>: it's it's very

00:17:24
kittih11: First time viewer and on mobile, where can I check more of your stuff?

00:17:26
<transcript>: It's it's very limited. What I want to do is I want to teach lots of people. I want to be able to help more people. Then I can help when I do consulting.

00:17:26
<transcript>: so

00:17:28
<transcript>: So Yeah.

00:17:32
<transcript>: I first time viewer you can check me out on.

00:17:32
<transcript>: well

00:17:32
fijiwater_gr: yo adam

00:17:47
<transcript>: Well, Twitter's, probably. I don't know. Where do I live on the Internet? I'm kind of a Nomad at the moment. I'd rather just live on Twitch if you do water. Oh, thank you so much for the prime subscription, Christoph. I appreciate that. Also, thanks for the follow Ellen grinds.

00:18:06
<transcript>: Okay. So I'm gonna wrap this up and we can start actually right in code and stuff. Somebody said they wanted to see my invent setup, so we should get on that. But I will wrap this all up with a little bow here. So what I'm gonna be doing is, I don't know, I'm gonna be making just a bunch of free stuff at first.

00:18:06
<transcript>: just

00:18:15
<transcript>: Just probably putting much stuff on YouTube teaching stuff at the intersection mostly like modern web development and cloud because that's kind of where I live.

00:18:18
<transcript>: Yeah. So I'm starting a YouTube channel.

00:18:18
<transcript>: it's gonna be

00:18:27
<transcript>: It's gonna be that's what I'm spinning my time during the week. I don't think it would make sense to stream at all. I don't I don't think I want to just create YouTube videos off of my streams.

00:18:27
<transcript>: that

00:18:29
<transcript>: That doesn't seem like.

00:18:29
<transcript>: the approach

00:18:31
<transcript>: The approach I'm gonna take.

00:18:31
cedpoilly: I am thinking of a way to re-use what I do with my one-on-one clients & put it out there

00:18:33
<transcript>: There's trade on.

00:18:33
<transcript>: obviously

00:18:46
<transcript>: Obviously then I could stream more, but I think I'm going to be creating some content that the process is going to be ugly at first, and I just I don't know that I'd feel right streaming. I wouldn't feel good about the quality of the streams.

00:18:54
<transcript>: So that's why two times a week, so Monday, Wednesday, and Fridays, I'm gonna be working on creating stuff. Youtube, stuff.

00:18:54
<transcript>: and

00:18:58
<transcript>: And ultimately trying to eventually turn that into something that could earn an income.

00:18:58
<transcript>: i

00:19:14
<transcript>: I probably will never make. I probably won't make half of what I make as a consultant, as a teacher. But I just don't care. The money was never the thing for me at this stage of my career. I've done pretty well at this point, 15 years in. And it's more important to me that I really, like care about what I'm doing.

00:19:21
<transcript>: And the problem is I do have to find a way to probably earn some money with it. If I'm gonna do it for you.

00:19:21
<transcript>: and not do

00:19:23
<transcript>: And not do consulting.

00:19:23
<transcript>: so

00:19:27
<transcript>: So, yeah, that's I'm open to ideas. Feel I'll have ideas about how.

00:19:27
<transcript>: somebody

00:19:34
<transcript>: Somebody can be an educator in tech and not the cringy kind that just money grabs or whatever.

00:19:34
<transcript>: that's what i'm going

00:19:35
<transcript>: That's what I'm going for.

00:19:35
<transcript>: okay

00:19:37
<transcript>: Okay.

00:19:37
<transcript>: we'll stop talking

00:19:56
<transcript>: We'll stop talking about all this stuff, and I'll actually do something. I'm thinking of a way to reuse what I do with my oneonone clients and put it out there. Yeah, that's not a bad idea. There's definitely ways to, like, maximize a career and consulting and make it impact others. And like, I just never figured it out. I think I just got too far into burnout with consulting.

00:20:04
fijiwater_gr: my life story as well lol

00:20:06
<transcript>: To even start trying to figure that out, but I don't think that that's a bad idea. I think said quality. I think you could definitely figure that out.

00:20:12
<transcript>: Feedblower your life story as well. Your consultant.

00:20:13
fijiwater_gr: im coding for 8 years right now on agencies

00:20:22
<transcript>: Or some kind of a freelancer struggling with this coding for eight years right now on Agencies. Yeah, yeah. I've I've put in my time. I think I'm ready for something different.

00:20:22
<transcript>: and

00:20:33
<transcript>: And I guess there's a possibility that I start trying this teaching thing. I start putting stuff on YouTube, and I realize I don't enjoy it because I do not have an experience with it.

00:20:36
cedpoilly: Here's a plan for you: start teaching full-time for a few months Then you can split your time between consulting & teach

00:20:38
<transcript>: It's possible. And I might come back to whatever.

00:20:38
<transcript>: consulting

00:20:39
<transcript>: Consulting.

00:20:42
andom: Sad that you don't stream more but happy for you starting this new journey :D

00:20:45
<transcript>: Here's a plan for you. Start teaching fulltime for a few months and you can split your time between consulting and teach. Yeah.

00:20:49
<transcript>: It's very possible that I end up.

00:20:57
<transcript>: Doing some more consulting. Just while I'm ramping up teaching and trying to figure out how to make that a career.

00:21:04
<transcript>: Yeah. I'm not opposed to it. I like it'd be nice to never have to go off and do consulting again.

00:21:04
<transcript>: but

00:21:05
<transcript>: But.

00:21:11
<transcript>: I don't know. I have no idea what it's gonna look like. This is like a year's long effort.

00:21:11
<transcript>: so

00:21:24
<transcript>: So. And I'm sad that you don't stream more, but happy for you starting the shoot journey. Yeah, I hope to eventually find a way to stream more while doing it like two times a week is just not gonna be enough for me. There's like a nap sign around my face. Oh, my goodness.

00:21:24
<transcript>: it's gonna

00:21:27
<transcript>: It's gonna end up in the water bowl. It's a giant water pit.

00:21:30
cedpoilly: If you need help generating ideas: I'd be happy to help & surely other here would love to help as well

00:21:33
<transcript>: Yeah, I'm gonna find a way just early on at least while I'm trying to build this up.

00:21:33
<transcript>: i'm probably

00:21:42
<transcript>: I'm probably gonna just do two days a week and then, oh, yeah. If I could use help generating ideas, you know what? That's that would be a huge help.

00:21:57
<transcript>: I'd love anybody in discord here. If you sit in here, I may not see them or I may forget. So discord discord would be preferred. I would love to get your ideas on things that you'd like to learn, that you think I have the experience with to teach.

00:21:57
<transcript>: it is hard

00:21:58
<transcript>: It is hard.

00:22:04
<transcript>: The longer you've been doing something, you know, it's hard to sort of go back to that beginner.

00:22:04
<transcript>: that begin

00:22:10
<transcript>: That beginner mind and see things fresh and see the struggles you know, in 2022, when people are learning.

00:22:10
<transcript>: web development

00:22:26
<transcript>: Web development or cloud development. I also probably want to focus more on, like 200 level, 300 level. Not like very beginner content. I know that's where there's more people that need help, but I also just don't know that at this point I'm really positioned to do that. Del void. Thank you so much for subscription.

00:22:26
<transcript>: now

00:22:31
tayloreddev: good morning

00:22:32
<transcript>: Now I'm trying to figure out why didn't get an alert for that, but thank you so much.

00:22:34
<transcript>: For the resub.

00:22:34
<transcript>: two months

00:22:35
<transcript>: Two months.

00:22:35
<transcript>: hey o

00:22:36
<transcript>: Hey o.

00:22:36
<transcript>: taylor's here

00:22:42
stroopwafel26: I would guess we'll see a lot of DynamoDB content to get people on board with that

00:22:45
<transcript>: Taylor's here. Good morning, Taylor. David. Really, thank you so much. I gotta figure out why I didn't get notified on that. I just happened to see it in chat.

00:22:51
<transcript>: We will see a lot of DynamoDB content to get people on board with that. Yeah, I know. I'm gonna talk about that. Mmodb.

00:22:51
<transcript>: i str

00:22:53
delvoid: scammed Kappa

00:22:59
<transcript>: I struggle because it feels very niche and I don't know how much content I can make. Scanned. Thanks for the follow tafier.

00:23:05
<transcript>: Yeah. No, boy, that was weird. It didn't show up on the overlays. It didn't. I didn't get anything.

00:23:05
<transcript>: i

00:23:07
<transcript>: I don't like it.

00:23:07
<transcript>: i'll go back

00:23:10
<transcript>: I'll go back to the lock or something.

00:23:13
<transcript>: Yeah, I.

00:23:13
<transcript>: like

00:23:26
delvoid: maybe it was just me, quickly someone else sub to test it ;)

00:23:27
<transcript>: Like doing stuff about Dynamo. I'm passionate about Dynamo. I think it's fantastic. The DevX is not great and I don't know how many people I could convince to like, go through the learning curve and deal with some of the Idio secrecies of Dynamo.

00:23:27
<transcript>: so that's

00:23:34
<transcript>: So that's why I've kind of been exploring more of the more common options, like Planet Scale, and just like trying to make sure.

00:23:39
<transcript>: I understand the landscape and what options you have. Maybe it was just me. Quickly. Someone else subtitles.

00:23:41
<transcript>: Nice.

00:23:43
cedpoilly: What happened to DynamiteDB?

00:23:46
<transcript>: All right, let's do something.

00:23:51
<transcript>: What happened to Dynamite DB? I didn't know Dynamo DB was a thing.

00:23:53
<transcript>: Dynamite.

00:23:53
<transcript>: that's a thing

00:23:55
<transcript>: That's a thing.

caldotjs: do we have any hunters in here? I am contemplating to get a license as "reward" for finishing my bachelors deg.

00:24:56
<transcript>: Drafting something about a cloud product based on DynamoDB. Yes. So I started working on a Tobs for web Dev as a course.

00:25:07
<transcript>: I think I'll still finish that, but it's possible. I'll convert it into this new effort, which is less building, like one course and more like creating lots and lots of training content.

00:25:07
<transcript>: i don't know

00:25:09
<transcript>: I don't know if that makes sense.

00:25:12
stderr: is <C-w-h> mapped to <C-h> in your neovim config

<transcript>: Any hunters in here. I'm confident to be the licenses reward for finish my bachelor's degree.

<transcript>: That's feeling better.

00:26:01
<transcript>: Alright.

00:26:05
stroopwafel26: @caldotjs I'm haunted by headhunters and recruiters so much that I first thought you were asking about that lmao

00:26:06
<transcript>: I don't know what it should be for you all.

00:26:08
<transcript>: Is control. Wh.

00:26:08

00:27:36
<transcript>: Oh, it's just like, no, I keep doing my leader keep for.

00:27:41
<transcript>: No.

00:27:49
<transcript>: Vsplit. Vsplit. Vsplit. Calbot. Thank you so much for the two months subscription. Why am I not getting notifications that's such a bummer.

00:27:49
<transcript>: it's such

00:27:51
<transcript>: It's such a bummer.

00:27:53
<transcript>: Ha.

00:27:57
<transcript>: Did something break are my overlays is broken.

00:28:01
<transcript>: I don't see any messages.

00:28:02
stroopwafel26: Donation stream hype?

11:16:16
<transcript>: Need to build again, see? It started again.

00:28:22
<transcript>: Got a new schedule. I kind of explained to the industry, I'm only streaming two days a week now, Tuesdays and Thursdays. It hurts me at my core. In fact, yesterday I tweeted.

00:28:34
jaystation3x: <slap>

00:28:38
<transcript>: That I would consider taking a fulltime role. I am unemployable. There's no way I would take a fulltime job, but then I realized I probably will if somebody just paid me to stream. If someone just like paid me to sit around on Twitch all day, my all my working days.

00:28:38
<transcript>: i'd probably do it

00:28:39
<transcript>: I'd probably do it.

00:28:44
<transcript>: That would be a reason. Hey, Caldot, there's a subscription to actually show up on screen.

00:28:44
<transcript>: that's leighton

00:28:50
<transcript>: That's Leighton, that was a latent subscription, so I'm sorry. Call that I didn't see it on the thing.

00:28:50
<transcript>: j

00:28:52
<transcript>: J slapping me.

00:28:53
tayloreddev: that's the dream paid to stream

00:28:54
<transcript>: Aj.

00:28:59
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat to Fear vs. Is Vertical Split. Thank you so much.

00:28:59
<transcript>: so if

00:29:03
<transcript>: so yeah

00:29:04
<transcript>: So Yeah.

00:29:09
<transcript>: Is my control. I keep doing my teamup leader, key.

00:29:09
<transcript>: let's see

00:29:11
<transcript>: Let's see, W.

00:29:18
<transcript>: A control W. H moves me over to that be split control W. So I guess it's not mapped.

00:29:18
<transcript>: oh it is

00:29:28
<transcript>: Oh, it is. Control. H. Control. L. Yeah, yeah, I did that. But I didn't do it vertically. So if I, like, horizontally, split, Nah, split. What is horizontal split.

00:29:31
<transcript>: Neovem, or vim, or whatever.

00:29:34
tafiir: :split

00:29:36
tafiir: LUL

00:29:37
<transcript>: Only two days. I know latent.

00:29:37
<transcript>: it

00:29:39
<transcript>: It really hurts me.

00:29:39
<transcript>: yeah

00:29:41
laytanl_: Did you get some new client work to take care of?

00:29:46
<transcript>: Yeah, Taylor, that would be the dream, right? Donation stream. Hype oh, we need to do we need to do a.

00:29:46
<transcript>: we need

00:29:52
<transcript>: We need to do like a charity stream. I don't know if I'm big enough to do a charity stream. I don't know what the requirements are.

00:29:52
<transcript>: or if there are

00:29:57
<transcript>: Or if there are retirement requirements. Did you get some new client words? Take care of no latent.

00:29:57
<transcript>: i'm

00:30:00
<transcript>: I'm trying to go down the path.

00:30:03
<transcript>: Of Education. I want to teach.

00:30:03
<transcript>: i want to stop consulting

00:30:04
<transcript>: I want to stop consulting.

00:30:04
<transcript>: so in

00:30:13
<transcript>: So in order to stop consulting, I've gotta earn an income from teaching. So I'm gonna start, like, I'm creating a YouTube channel. You'll still see me a lot. I'm gonna be on YouTube.

00:30:13
<transcript>: i'm just

00:30:25
<transcript>: I'm just gonna be on Twitter less, but then hopefully once I get it kind of up off the ground, I'll be on Twitch more. I'd like to spend five days a week streaming. I really was. And maybe I will. Maybe I'll get back to it.

00:30:29
<transcript>: Split. Thank you. To fear. Wow. Okay.

00:30:29
<transcript>: you're coming through

00:30:38
<transcript>: You're coming through. So I don't think I've done this with, like, control J and control K. Yeah. No. So I have to do the control W for vertical.

00:30:40
<transcript>: See that.

00:30:44
<transcript>: But for horizontal, for whatever reason.

00:30:47
<transcript>: I have I have it without the W.

00:30:51
<transcript>: Think I got that from somebody.

00:30:58
<transcript>: Alright. So we're working on AW guess.

00:30:58
<transcript>: what

00:31:01
<transcript>: What is? Aw, guess. Eight of you guess.

00:31:01
<transcript>: is

00:31:06
<transcript>: Is a guessing game. Okay. So first of all, what it really is.

00:31:06
<transcript>: is

00:31:07
<transcript>: Is.

00:31:18
<transcript>: An excuse for me to learn T three stack, and I might actually build this same app. I might build this with like, five different stacks that I really want to play with because there's just a lot of sacks I really want to play with.

00:31:27
<transcript>: But what it is is like you see us an AWS Service icon. You'll see here if it's working. Yeah. So you get an icon and you have to.

00:31:33
cedpoilly: A lot of viewers will ask about the new schedule. Maybe you could set a  !newschedule command?

00:31:34
<transcript>: Okay. I broke it. But you have to guess. What is this one? I think it's migration. Evaluator.

00:31:43
<transcript>: Correct. Okay. So that's the idea. Wow. Yeah. I broke it. Broke it a lot. We'll fix it. We had some things working now. They're not.

00:31:52
<transcript>: Let's see. I don't want all these V splits. And you know what I'm gonna do? I'm just gonna. There we go. I'll quit him. Okay.

00:31:57
<transcript>: Thanks so much to follow. Array. Eric Esque in Mac.

00:32:03
stroopwafel26: also update the description below the straem

00:32:05
<transcript>: A lot of viewers will ask about the new schedule. Maybe you could set a new schedule. Command. Oh, that's a good idea, said Polly. That's a great idea.

00:32:06
stroopwafel26: stream*

00:32:07
<transcript>: Fantastic idea.

00:32:07
<transcript>: update the

00:32:25
<transcript>: Update the description below the stream. Thank you for the follow. Enjoy to live. What do you mean? Stroop the description below the stream building AWS with the T three stack also waking up. I guess that's not okay. Got my face. What is it? I mean, I'm happy with the high train, but now I can't see chat.

00:32:26
stroopwafel26: the "who, what, when"

00:32:27
<transcript>: There we go.

00:32:27
<transcript>: let's see

00:32:33
aliwolfi1: hi guys

00:32:36
<transcript>: Let's see. Topic. You know this. Oh, the who, what? Win. Oh, no. Do I have my schedule in that, too? On my channel.

00:32:38
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:32:42
<transcript>: Twitch Adam Dev.

00:32:45
<transcript>: If I need to update something here.

00:32:45
<transcript>: i

00:32:47
<transcript>: I mute me.

00:32:50
<transcript>: Who.

00:32:59
<transcript>: What I'm streaming full sacred hatch version. Oh, oh, public, I should say public. I'm probably gonna, like, sell public Dev.

00:32:59
<transcript>: just

00:33:10
<transcript>: Just honestly, not like I think I can make a ton of money on it. I'm just gonna sell it to recoup costs just for what I paid. David's design it, and I wouldn't sell it if the person. I didn't think the person could take it forward.

00:33:10
<transcript>: and like

00:33:12
<transcript>: And like actually.

00:33:12
<transcript>: realize

00:33:29
<transcript>: Realize it because I want to use it, and I want it to exist. But I just I'm being realistic with myself. I'm probably not gonna devote a lot of attention to it. And that makes me sad, because I really like it the idea of it. I've loved working on it. So yeah, I put it on Micro acquire. We'll see.

00:33:29
<transcript>: if i can find

00:33:33
<transcript>: If I can find somebody a good home for public devs.

00:33:33
<transcript>: hi guys

00:33:52
<transcript>: Hi, guys. Hi, Ollie. Welcome to my chat, Ollie. I appreciate so I need to update that the active projects do not include public Dev, personals custom switch overlay. Okay, I stream each weekday morning. Yeah, that's not true anymore. It's such a bummer. I really don't even want to. Like, I don't want to accept it, you know.

00:33:52
<transcript>: it's

00:33:54
aliwolfi1: trpc vs graphQl ?! who win ?!

00:33:54
<transcript>: It's like.

00:33:57
<transcript>: Still pains me.

00:34:01
<transcript>: Where do I update the panel's cancel.

00:34:05
<transcript>: Edit panels. Alright. Here we go.

00:34:09
<transcript>: Tuesdays. And there, where does it win.

00:34:09
<transcript>: oh

00:34:11
<transcript>: Oh, man.

00:34:11
<transcript>: each

00:34:15
<transcript>: Each Tuesday. That's not the letters Tuesday.

00:34:16
<transcript>: And Thursday.

00:34:21
<transcript>: Morning from that's not accurate anymore.

00:34:21
<transcript>: i'm doing

00:34:33
<transcript>: I'm doing 06:00 a.m.. That's another thing I'm streaming later. I hope that doesn't. I don't lose friends that I got to hang out with every day trip versus graphical who win. They're both good.

00:34:33
<transcript>: they're both good

00:34:36
<transcript>: They're both good. Thank you for the follow acres.

00:34:43
<transcript>: And enjoy to live. Oh, I should put something in my title today that this is a drama free stream. I don't know if you saw the Twitch drama yesterday.

00:34:43
<transcript>: this one will be

00:34:45
<transcript>: This one will be drama free.

00:34:45
<transcript>: through that kind of

00:34:48
<transcript>: Through that kind of thing. Thanks for the follow alley. I appreciate that.

00:34:50
<transcript>: So.

00:34:50
<transcript>: each tuesday

00:34:55
<transcript>: Each Tuesday and Thursday morning from 09:00 a.m.. So what will this time actually be? It will be.

00:34:55
<transcript>: eleven

00:34:57
<transcript>: 11:00. A.m.

00:34:57
<transcript>: to

00:34:58
stroopwafel26: you're streaming just an hour later, right? 1 pm for me, perfect :P

00:34:58
<transcript>: To.

00:35:02
<transcript>: 03:00 p.m.

00:35:11
stiefbroerikzitvast: dude youre already a 70 viewer andy. You're making star_ansible jealous.

00:35:20
stiefbroerikzitvast: he's pissed af

00:35:22
<transcript>: So I'm streaming a little bit later. That's also strategic. It gives me a little time to do things in the morning before I stream. Man, this. All this sounds like less streaming, and it pains me to my core. My favorite thing in the world to do is to just build stupid stuff and stream. I wish I could just do this all day. Maybe someday I could. Maybe.

00:35:22
<transcript>: maybe i'll

00:35:25
<transcript>: Maybe I'll actually retire, and I'll just be able to do this all day. Every day.

00:35:25
<transcript>: stream

00:35:29
<transcript>: Stream from. Okay, this is no longer.

00:35:36
<transcript>: Just gonna delete all this. I'm not streaming from 04:00 a.m. Day to Amb.

00:35:40
laytanl_: Maybe you could record your educational stuff on stream?

00:35:47
<transcript>: Afternoon stream. Yeah, that's true. I still make occasionally do like guest streams in the afternoon because I do. I've rearranged my work schedule. My wife and I.

00:35:47
<transcript>: worked out

00:35:49
laytanl_: But thats more work I guess

00:35:51
<transcript>: Worked out a new schedule where I've got more time in the afternoon as well.

00:35:54
<transcript>: Maybe you could record your educational stuff. Yeah, I think.

00:35:54
<transcript>: i

00:35:56
<transcript>: I think so.

00:35:56
<transcript>: i think so

00:36:05
<transcript>: I think so. I think I could record some educational stuff on Stream and we'll see if I'm doing a video or doing whatever.

00:36:05
<transcript>: and

00:36:06
<transcript>: And.

00:36:06
<transcript>: it seems like

00:36:23
<transcript>: It seems like this is content people might enjoy. I'll just do a pop up stream. I just don't want to commit to too much and I want people expecting to be on Monday, Wednesday, Fridays, but I can't imagine I'll stay away like tomorrow. Even I'm thinking about how it's gonna be really hard not to stream tomorrow after just getting back to it and being so excited to stream today.

00:36:23
<transcript>: we'll see

00:36:24
<transcript>: We'll see.

00:36:24
<transcript>: okay

00:36:25
<transcript>: Okay.

00:36:30
<transcript>: Aw guess so let's build this thing.

00:36:33
<transcript>: Let's see, I've got it running here.

00:36:37
<transcript>: We've got planet scale connected.

00:36:43
<transcript>: Like I haven't touched this thing since we would have last seen each other.

00:36:45
<transcript>: Step, row.

00:36:45
<transcript>: step rose

00:36:50
<transcript>: Step Rose here just an hour later, right? Yeah, that's right. I'm an hour later.

00:36:56
<transcript>: But it's 2 hours later than when I first started streaming. I've kind of pushed it back an hour, twice.

00:36:56
<transcript>: thanks for the

00:37:17
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow. Valentinius. If I didn't already say that if I said it already think it twice. Thanks twice twice for that follow. You get two. Thanks. So step Row, do you're already a 70 viewer? Andy, you're making Star a little toast. Oh, no, I love starrings. Well, we are connected on LinkedIn and he gave me a raid when I didn't know to raid was he rated me like.

00:37:17
<transcript>: my first week

00:37:18
<transcript>: My first week.

00:37:22
<transcript>: I hope you're joking that he's actually upset.

00:37:22
<transcript>: fuming ma

00:37:25
<transcript>: Fuming. Max, thanks so much for the following Max.

00:37:29

00:37:36
stiefbroerikzitvast: the apprentice already surpassed the master

00:37:42
<transcript>: Actually know that reference two separate the Andy. I know what an Andy is super pessimist.

00:37:44
<transcript>: That's terrible.

00:37:44
<transcript>: a seventy

00:37:45
stiefbroerikzitvast: hail to the new king of dev twitch

00:37:47
<transcript>: A 70 of you are Andy like I actually understood that.

00:37:47
<transcript>: i

00:37:55
<transcript>: I I looked up Andy one day maybe you were the person that said Andy. Somebody said Andy on Stream. And we did the Gin Z Google thing.

00:38:15
<transcript>: Okay, source, let's get into this. So we've got a game router. Oh, and PrPC version ten beta just came out and it's good for production, which means it's good for anything I ever work on. If he said if Alex said it's good for production, that means it's way good for anything I build because anything I build is hardly production.

00:38:22
<transcript>: Like, Is this thing? Is this thing ever gonna be considered production? I don't know. I'll publish it, but.

00:38:26
<transcript>: New King of Dead Twitch net. Okay, now you're just getting.

00:38:26
<transcript>: way out of

00:38:28
<transcript>: Way out of hand separate.

00:38:28
<transcript>: there

00:38:34
<transcript>: There is there are there are Kings of debtwitch. And there are fights over it.

00:38:34
<transcript>: i'm sure you saw

00:38:50
<transcript>: I'm sure you saw that. In fact, step, bro. I think I saw you in Jordan's Chat yesterday. I was lurking. I was listening. I was gonna miss that drama. That was too good. I mean, it's bad. I feel bad for everyone involved. I'm a type nine Enneagram. I just want to fix it all. I want to come in and mediate.

00:38:50
<transcript>: but that

00:38:57
<transcript>: But that's not my job. And nobody knows who I am. So I can't be like Jordan. Listen. Let's talk. Theo, come here, let's talk.

00:38:57
<transcript>: i know

00:39:08
<transcript>: I know, co I don't know, Jordan. And yeah, it's not my place, but I wish I kind of wish I were, like, a big streamer, so I could be like, Listen, I'm good at conflict mediation. Let's talk this through.

00:39:08
<transcript>: i don't think there's

00:39:11
<transcript>: I don't think there's a lot of talking for you though in that situation.

00:39:12
laytanl_: I have no idea what that all was yesterday

00:39:12
<transcript>: To happen.

00:39:12
<transcript>: no talking

00:39:16
laytanl_: only saw the tweets

00:39:16
<transcript>: No talking, no talking to be had. Unfortunately. Okay.

00:39:16
<transcript>: so

00:39:19
caasidev: heyup

00:39:21
laytanl_: no idea who jordan is

00:39:23
<transcript>: So create round we get random item and then I was trying to make sure that we don't get the same one.

00:39:23
<transcript>: multip

00:39:27
<transcript>: Multiply. I did the opposite.

00:39:31
<transcript>: Apparently. Now we're getting the same one every time. Let's see.

00:39:40
<transcript>: Two children with the same key. Okay, well, that's bad. Let's see what the network call looks like, though.

00:39:45
<transcript>: Game start.

00:39:47
<transcript>: Let's see here.

00:39:49
stroopwafel26: So many things happen that I have no idea of, and I'm kinda glad because I don't need drama in my life :D

00:39:51
<transcript>: Answer choices.

00:39:51
<transcript>: okay

00:39:57
<transcript>: Okay. So the choices are all the same. Good to know that's the thing we wanted to avoid.

00:40:02
<transcript>: Oh, well, yeah, that would do it.

00:40:02
<transcript>: where it

00:40:08
<transcript>: Where it equals the first thing. Oh, no, I'm filtering. Oh, yeah, yeah, that's not what I think it is.

00:40:08
<transcript>: okay

00:40:13
<transcript>: Okay, JavaScript thing. Let's do some teaching. I'll teach myself.

00:40:13
<transcript>: so when

00:40:15
<transcript>: So when you filter.

00:40:15
<transcript>: it only

00:40:18
<transcript>: It only includes the ones that matter.

00:40:25
<transcript>: What I've got selected.

00:40:25
<transcript>: and

00:40:31
<transcript>: And I'm saying only find the resources where the name equals the first name, what I meant to do.

00:40:31
<transcript>: was

00:40:34
<transcript>: Was where it doesn't equal the name.

00:40:34
<transcript>: there's some

00:40:42
<transcript>: There's some teaching for you. I taught. I'm a teacher. A talk. Anybody? What about Bob? Did you get that reference.

00:40:42
<transcript>: what about bob

00:40:46
<transcript>: What about Bob? He's like, I'm a sailor. I sailed.

00:40:46
jaystation3x: I struggle with that to. I think of filter as "filter out."

00:40:50
<transcript>: Okay.

00:40:50
<transcript>: so

00:40:52
<transcript>: So fix all of these.

00:40:52
stroopwafel26: TIL about operators, thanks @adamdotdev !

00:40:55
jaystation3x: I'm sailing!

00:40:58
<transcript>: Let's see if I can do something better with my BIM navigation. I'm trying to I'm trying to learn Prime.

00:40:59
cedpoilly: Professor Adam?

00:41:04
ryankhawkins: "teaching moment"?

00:41:05
<transcript>: His his courses or his little YouTube videos about navigating better I'm just so slow I still gotta get fast.

00:41:09
<transcript>: Okay.

00:41:09
<transcript>: round now this

00:41:12
<transcript>: Round. Now. This should work. This should work correctly, I think.

00:41:14
ryankhawkins: Good morning, everyone

00:41:16
<transcript>: A teaching moment? Professor Adam.

00:41:16
<transcript>: i'm sailing

00:41:21
<transcript>: I'm sailing, Jay. Good jig gets it. What about Bob? Richard? Drive us good movie.

00:41:23
<transcript>: Hey oh, Cassie, dad.

00:41:23
<transcript>: hey up

00:41:26
<transcript>: Hey, up? What's going on.

00:41:30
<transcript>: You don't know what was going on. Yeah. If you just saw the tweets latent.

00:41:30
<transcript>: there was a twitch

00:41:35
<transcript>: There was a Twitch stream that was an extension of the tweet.

00:41:35
<transcript>: basically

00:41:41
fragaverage: Starlink finally arrived!

00:41:43
<transcript>: Basically Jordan got on and just kind of like went through Beo's whole video and like pause that every 15 seconds and head comments.

00:41:43
<transcript>: jordan

00:41:45
<transcript>: Jordan. I guess Jordan is.

00:41:52
<transcript>: He used to be a really big Twitch streamer and he's retired now.

00:41:52
<transcript>: so

00:41:53
<transcript>: So.

00:41:53
<transcript>: he's the

00:42:03
<transcript>: He's the opposite of what I want to be. He was a really big twist streamer who retired. I just want to Twitch stream. I wish I could retire from everything else and just stream.

00:42:07
<transcript>: Some of things happen. I have no idea.

00:42:07
<transcript>: kind of

00:42:13
<transcript>: Kind of glad because I didn't need drama. Yeah, nobody needs the drama. We really don't.

00:42:22
<transcript>: Yeah, Jay, you struggle with that, too. Okay, so filter seems like it should filter them out. Yeah. I'm not alone here. There's not a there's not like a built in.

00:42:27
<transcript>: Function that does what I were thinking. Is there, like, exclude.

00:42:27
<transcript>: or something

00:42:28
<transcript>: Or something.

00:42:29
fragaverage: reduce?

00:42:30
jaystation3x: I like "where"

00:42:34
<transcript>: Today, I learned about operators. You're welcome.

00:42:36
<transcript>: Good Morning. Ryan.

00:42:36
<transcript>: good morning

00:42:38
<transcript>: Good morning.

00:42:38
<transcript>: star

00:42:40
<transcript>: Starlink finally arrived? What.

00:42:40
<transcript>: reduce

00:42:44
<transcript>: Reduce aware there's a where.

00:42:47
<transcript>: No. Is it really.

00:42:52
<transcript>: No. You're saying you like wearing some other language.

00:42:57
jaystation3x: In other langs and frameworks

00:43:01
<transcript>: We did it now we have different options. I'm gonna be way too late to answer this, but I don't have the expiration thing working, so I guess not.

00:43:01
<transcript>: okay

00:43:02
<transcript>: Okay.

00:43:09
<transcript>: So this is the idea. You get these service icons. There's like 300 AWS services.

00:43:12
<transcript>: You have to choose the right one. Right.

00:43:18
<transcript>: Here's gonna be a timer. We started building a timer.

00:43:18
<transcript>: it's just fake right now

00:43:19
<transcript>: It's just fake right now.

00:43:19
<transcript>: it just shows up

00:43:22
stroopwafel26: @jaystation3x Hooray for SQL

00:43:25
<transcript>: It just shows up on the screen, like at a random interval, but there's gonna be a ten second timer. You got to answer in the 10 seconds.

00:43:31
<transcript>: And again, we're learning. I'm just learning PrPC. Basically, I'm building with the T three stack.

00:43:31
<transcript>: i feel

00:43:34
<transcript>: I feel like my mic is too far away.

00:43:34
<transcript>: but i'm

00:43:38
<transcript>: But I'm gonna leave it. We're doing it with SQL.

00:43:38
<transcript>: we're building

00:43:42
<transcript>: We're building stuff with a SQL database. It's not my typical.

00:43:42
<transcript>: norm

00:43:45
<transcript>: Normally a DynamoDB kind of guy.

00:43:56
<transcript>: Let's see. So we have new game. We have Start game, which creates your first round. And then we have answer.

00:44:01
<transcript>: Does what.

00:44:03
<transcript>: Answer the.

00:44:06
<transcript>: Correct.

00:44:10
<transcript>: And then we have all our resources. Okay.

00:44:13
<transcript>: Let's go to our index.

00:44:13
<transcript>: page

00:44:16
<transcript>: Page my my.

00:44:16
<transcript>: i

00:44:21
<transcript>: I gotta talk to Tiege Well, I don't need a bug page, but my telescope.

00:44:27
<transcript>: Like on load is so slow now I updated everything to latest and that might be why.

00:44:30
<transcript>: It's like it's fast. Once it's loaded.

00:44:30
<transcript>: like typing

00:44:34
noctumsempra: !commands

00:44:34
fossabot: @Noctumsempra Channel commands are available at: https://fossabot.com/adamdotdev/commands

00:44:35
<transcript>: Like typing and stuff is fast. It's just it's really slow to initialize or something.

00:44:35
<transcript>: and

00:44:41
stroopwafel26: Can't get over Planetscale, such a great name. I recently recommended it to a client who needs a lot of scalability on their postgres DB after I've seen it on this stream

00:44:45
<transcript>: And it's no matter how big the thing like I've tried it in small repos. Big Reposit just seems to be like Loading slowly. I don't know what I did.

00:44:45
<transcript>: i'm using that

00:44:47
<transcript>: I'm using that SDS plugin.

00:44:57
w3barsi: i just installed neovim on WSL and im doing fine

00:45:07
<transcript>: Can't get over plant scale. Such a great name recently recommended to a client who needs a lot of scope and other postcodes to be after seen on soon. Yeah, I don't think that Stroop. It's not Postgres, is it? It's only my sequel. That's the one thing that bothers me. I think they get a lot of their scalability from this special YouTube. Mysql thing like engine.

00:45:15
<transcript>: But it's not Postgres, and a lot of people want Postgres, so I guess there's neon that's coming.

00:45:15
<transcript>: which is

00:45:15
stroopwafel26: ugh I meant MySQL, I'm currently working on postgres, sorry

00:45:19
w3barsi: my telescope is doing fine*

00:45:21
<transcript>: Which is a Cool name as well. Just install Neovem on WSL, and I'm doing fine, cool W, three.

00:45:21
<transcript>: neilvin is great

00:45:24
<transcript>: Neilvin is great. I am a huge fan.

00:45:24
<transcript>: oh you may

00:45:30
<transcript>: Oh, you may be well, you're good, you're good. Ya know, Postgres is definitely something a lot of people want.

00:45:30
<transcript>: and

00:45:41
<transcript>: And I wish I wish plants go were like somehow both. But I know that fundamentally doesn't work because they get all of their goodness from that that whatever that opens up. My sequel thing is.

00:45:41
<transcript>: your telescopes

00:45:54
<transcript>: Your telescopes. Oh, your telescope. I gotcha your telescopes in fine. W three. Okay. That makes a lot more sense in context. Now that I understand what you're trying to say. Yeah. Okay. So, do you have latest? Is it like.

00:45:54
<transcript>: are you using

00:45:56
<transcript>: Are you using Neoven.

00:45:56
<transcript>: eight

00:45:58
<transcript>: 80, eight.

00:45:58
<transcript>: which is like

00:46:05
w3barsi: yes, i always build from source

00:46:06
<transcript>: Which is like the development I'm using like the literal latest commit version of Neil Them. I don't. Why do I do this to myself? Why do I use.

00:46:06
<transcript>: the bleeding

00:46:07
fragaverage: deploy your own supabase instance

00:46:09
<transcript>: The bleeding. I don't bleed. Responsibly.

00:46:14
<transcript>: You're on super base.

00:46:17
<transcript>: For Postgres. You mean frag.

00:46:24
<transcript>: I don't like to deploy my own anything. I prefer to deploy as few things as possible.

00:46:26
<transcript>: I get what you're saying.

00:46:29
w3barsi: have you tried using railway for postgress?

00:46:42
laytanl_: Im on the latest/nightly commit and it works fine

00:46:43
<transcript>: Okay. So what do we need to do here? We need to fix some stuff in the front end, which we are in the front end right now.

00:46:43
<transcript>: hand

00:46:44
fragaverage: or use their cloud hosted version, I just found the limitations to kick in real quick in my production usage.

00:46:52
<transcript>: Handle answer. We have a current round. Sorry. It's been five days. I'm just. I'm getting I don't even remember this project. Hardly.

00:46:52
<transcript>: but i

00:46:54
<transcript>: But I want to get back at speed.

00:46:54
<transcript>: okay

00:47:05
<transcript>: Okay, so the one of the things that's wrong is when you answer this is gonna be like a Sage major. Yeah, it's not showing the green border. What did I do? How did I break it.

00:47:05
<transcript>: order

00:47:08
<transcript>: Order. Green nine. What if I just do it right here.

00:47:18
<transcript>: For the Green Nine does not work, okay? Is it.

00:47:23
<transcript>: The colors? Did I mess up.

00:47:26
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, it's the colors.

00:47:26
<transcript>: the color

00:47:33
<transcript>: The colors? Duke, the colors? Anybody remember that reference? I'm digging way into the bag of American pop culture.

00:47:33
<transcript>: i

00:47:36
<transcript>: I'm so disconnected hang on.

00:47:56
<transcript>: I apologize for whatever that ASMR was it was me. Move my mic stand. I'm so unconnected from pop culture present day, like the last five years, eight years. Something like that. I have no understanding of pop culture. Like, I just don't know anything. I'm not connected to anything that would feed me pop culture.

00:47:59
<transcript>: But you go prior to that.

00:47:59
<transcript>: like the

00:48:09
<transcript>: Like the previous 20 years, and I know lots of stuff. So like American pop culture from the early OTS, and like 90s.

00:48:09
<transcript>: got it

00:48:15
<transcript>: Got it. I can make references all day, but they're like, all my pop culture references are frozen in time back there.

00:48:15
<transcript>: so i'm

00:48:20
<transcript>: So I'm sorry for that because none of them will make any sense to anybody. Probably.

00:48:27
<transcript>: If you try using railway for Postgres, I have not, but I want to try railway. I do want to try rails away.

00:48:35
<transcript>: It works. Fine. Latent. Okay. So something on my machine. It's some other. Maybe some other plugin I'm using.

00:48:38
<transcript>: I'll need to do some like troubleshooting.

00:48:38
<transcript>: see how

00:48:39
<transcript>: See how slow it is.

00:48:39
<transcript>: pull up

00:48:41
<transcript>: Pull up.

00:48:44
<transcript>: Like there's a two or 3 seconds delay.

00:48:50
ryankhawkins: I learned most of my pop culture watching Seinfeld.

00:48:53
<transcript>: These are cloud host version. I just found the limitation to kick in real quick in my production uses. You guys are all talking about for Postgres right.

00:48:55
laytanl_: Yeah that's not normal

00:48:58
<transcript>: Ryan, now we're talking Seinfeld.

00:49:02
<transcript>: Love, Seinfeld.

00:49:05
w3barsi: could it be because you have something else bound to ff?

00:49:09
<transcript>: Yeah, it's not normal. Okay, so it's not. It's not normal. We've determined. Definitely not normal.

00:49:16
<transcript>: Bummer. I'll need to figure it out. So why is green networking? I have these green colors.

00:49:21
<transcript>: Have some green colors now.

00:49:21
<transcript>: why can't i

00:49:24
<transcript>: Why can't I use them.

00:49:27
<transcript>: Border, green, nine.

00:49:32
<transcript>: Five border Green. Yeah, look, they're even showing up there.

00:49:37
<transcript>: Hard refresh. I don't know.

00:49:37
<transcript>: so

00:49:39
<transcript>: So like a stale.

00:49:41
laytanl_: Can you try execute `:map <leader>ff`

00:49:41
<transcript>: No.

00:49:43
<transcript>: Well, let's inspect.

00:49:47
<transcript>: Let's inspect.

00:49:50
<transcript>: Border, bottom color.

00:49:50
<transcript>: that doesn't

00:49:55
<transcript>: That doesn't look what so that show the color. Thank you for the follow yacht code.

00:50:02
laytanl_: assuming you have it set to <leader>ff

00:50:02
<transcript>: Execute map leader FF. I can try that. What is that gonna do.

00:50:02
<transcript>: matt

00:50:04
<transcript>: Matt.

00:50:08
<transcript>: Yeah, it's Leader, FF.

00:50:08
<transcript>: leader

00:50:09
<transcript>: Leader.

00:50:11
<transcript>: Ff.

00:50:14
<transcript>: Oh.

00:50:19
<transcript>: Is it that I have too many things going on with this lease.

00:50:20
w3barsi: there's your problem

00:50:23
<transcript>: Fsh O Yeah, I added FSH.

00:50:23
<transcript>: oh

00:50:25
<transcript>: Oh.

00:50:25
<transcript>: i need to remove

00:50:27
<transcript>: I need to remove SSH.

00:50:32
yatko: yo stream quality is insane man everything looks so clean

00:50:32
<transcript>: That's the problem. I was trying to find a way. There's your problem. There we go.

00:50:32
<transcript>: let's see

00:50:33
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:50:34
laytanl_: Yeah its waiting for the h or not

00:50:38
<transcript>: Config.

00:50:38
<transcript>: let's see here's

00:50:40
<transcript>: Let's see here's. My Dot files.

00:50:43
<transcript>: Actually gonna.

00:50:43
<transcript>: do

00:50:45
<transcript>: Do this.

00:50:47
<transcript>: Cd.

00:50:50
<transcript>: Files.

00:50:56
<transcript>: Config envym and let's open it that way.

00:50:58
<transcript>: Okay.

00:50:58
<transcript>: let's

00:51:01
<transcript>: Let's see, what am I looking for.

00:51:03
<transcript>: Telescope.

00:51:17
<transcript>: I guess it would be in my.

00:51:17
<transcript>: mapping

00:51:18
<transcript>: Mapping.

00:51:22
<transcript>: The delay.

00:51:22
<transcript>: maps

00:51:23
<transcript>: Maps.

00:51:23
<transcript>: it is

00:51:24
<transcript>: It is.

00:51:28
<transcript>: Nope.

00:51:33
<transcript>: There we go.

00:51:33
<transcript>: get rid of those

00:51:45
w3barsi: or just do "fh" for hidden files

00:51:48
<transcript>: Get rid of those. I was trying. This is. It was dumb. I only want to explain what I try and do. I was trying to have a keymap for hidden files as well, but it's waiting for the H, so it's not telescope. I'm so glad you guys helped me with that. And I didn't like DMT's.

00:51:48
<transcript>: super dumb

00:51:49
<transcript>: Super dumb problem.

00:51:51
<transcript>: I would have felt bad.

00:51:57
<transcript>: Okay. Teach. You don't have anything better to do than to tell me how to use them.

00:52:07
<transcript>: Yatko. Welcome to Chat. Your stream quality is insane, man, everything looks so clean. Thanks so much. A lot of the looking clean is David Hill.

00:52:07
<transcript>: he's my designer

00:52:08
<transcript>: He's My designer friend. David.

00:52:09
adamdotdev: !david

00:52:10
fossabot: Adam regularly uses David Hill for design work. You can check out David's personal site at https://iamdavidhill.com/ which includes links to socials!

00:52:17
<transcript>: David. So he designed all my overlays, and you should check him out. He's fantastic. So he's the reason it looks so good.

00:52:24
<transcript>: Just shoot sh for hidden files. I think I'm just gonna remove him for now, but yeah, if I ever do decide I need to know.

00:52:28
<transcript>: Or need to have those hidden files. We can. We can do that.

00:52:28
<transcript>: thanks for the

00:52:30
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow Natan.

00:52:32
<transcript>: Nathan.

00:52:38
<transcript>: Let's do this. Let's exit and reopen. Now.

00:52:38
<transcript>: so fast

00:52:39
<transcript>: So fast.

00:52:39
<transcript>: feels good

00:52:43
<transcript>: Feels good so just waiting on the key. Wow.

00:52:45
<transcript>: I'm sorry.

00:52:49
<transcript>: I mean, I don't know. I shouldn't say things like that.

00:52:49
<transcript>: but

00:52:50
<transcript>: But.

00:52:50
<transcript>: that was

00:52:52
<transcript>: That was a pretty dumb thing to do.

00:52:52
<transcript>: okay

00:52:54
<transcript>: Okay.

00:52:54
<transcript>: back here

00:52:55
<transcript>: Back here.

00:52:59
<transcript>: We're trying to figure out why the colors.

00:53:02
<transcript>: Are the colors aren't working.

00:53:05
<transcript>: Border, green, knots.

00:53:07
<transcript>: So.

00:53:18
<transcript>: I was inspecting. I was looking. I was looking at styles. Let's see. Is it does it have the border green, nine style on it.

00:53:22
<transcript>: Text, Orange, nine.

00:53:27
<transcript>: Border. Green Nine. Now. What's? What's the deal? Here.

00:53:31
<transcript>: What's this about? It's got all these applied to it.

00:53:31
<transcript>: why

00:53:33
<transcript>: Why would have all of them.

00:53:42
<transcript>: Relative Order to Border Orange, nine.

00:53:42
<transcript>: what

00:53:43
<transcript>: What.

00:53:45
<transcript>: The Orange is correct.

00:53:45
<transcript>: background

00:53:48
<transcript>: Background blue. Three. That's fine.

00:53:50
<transcript>: Do we have.

00:53:52
<transcript>: Focus.

00:53:52
<transcript>: hover

00:53:53
<transcript>: Hover.

00:53:53
<transcript>: dis

00:53:58
<transcript>: Disable order. Green nine. There. So it's not overriding.

00:53:58
<transcript>: okay

00:54:07
<transcript>: Okay. Is that just maybe a tailwind thing? Can you not just override? If you specify a different border green later, you can't just override it, I guess.

00:54:09
<transcript>: Thought that was the thing.

00:54:18
<transcript>: Interesting. Well.

00:54:21
<transcript>: We'll have to take this a different route.

00:54:24
<transcript>: So the button itself.

00:54:24
<transcript>: spec

00:54:26
<transcript>: Specifies here.

00:54:26
<transcript>: at the board

00:54:28
<transcript>: At the Board, Orange.

00:54:32
<transcript>: And the problem with that is we're trying to override it.

00:54:47
<transcript>: I feel like I've seen something in, like, recent release notes. Like I've seen something where there's something that makes this possible.

00:54:52
<transcript>: Let's do this. Let's do tailwind.

00:54:52
<transcript>: over

00:54:55
<transcript>: Override class? I don't know.

00:54:59
<transcript>: Overriding. Yeah.

00:55:03
<transcript>: Here's a Reddit comment. Don't want to try that.

00:55:16
<transcript>: More helpful. Basically two ways you can solve this. Create a button class.

00:55:26
<transcript>: You could do important. I could do important. Is that bad.

00:55:31
<transcript>: Is that bad.

00:55:34
<transcript>: Tailwind override.

00:55:40
<transcript>: What is this.

00:55:45
<transcript>: Anybody solve this problem anybody have a best.

00:55:54
stroopwafel26: !important is never the solution

00:55:57
<transcript>: Like a good idea about how to best handle this function. To remove clashing, tail and CS glasses where the rightmost one wins. I guess this won't work when I'm sorting. Well, no. Yeah, well.

00:56:01
<transcript>: I don't want to introduce like a thing. I have to.

00:56:01
<transcript>: call like

00:56:02
<transcript>: Call like that.

00:56:05
<transcript>: Important is never this little.

00:56:05
<transcript>: street says

00:56:07
<transcript>: Street says which I can respect.

00:56:10
<transcript>: Okay.

00:56:15
<transcript>: Well.

00:56:22
<transcript>: Turns out space upper is useless.

00:56:38
<transcript>: Let's similar like I'd have to call it right? I just feels bad.

00:56:47
<transcript>: Maybe I should just think about this differently. Think about it differently. I'm trying to do something that's not a thing.

00:56:47
<transcript>: trying to over

00:56:49
<transcript>: Trying to override.

00:56:56
<transcript>: Classes. Okay. What is this one? Let's just drop something.

00:57:04
<transcript>: It's weird, though. This was working. Maybe it wasn't. It wasn't working, was it.

00:57:12
<transcript>: Was yeah, if I use like Bordergreen 500 here it works.

00:57:12
<transcript>: right

00:57:15
<transcript>: Right which is the builtin green.

00:57:19
<transcript>: And Red, 500.

00:57:24
<transcript>: So if I say that is quick sight.

00:57:24
<transcript>: no it doesn't

00:57:26
<transcript>: No, it doesn't work. Never mind.

00:57:28
<transcript>: Never mind.

00:57:30
<transcript>: Elasticache.

00:57:30
<transcript>: okay

00:57:36
<transcript>: Okay, I think for the following Chico, Bash, Shakowan, bash.

00:57:51
<transcript>: Well.

00:57:58
<transcript>: Is the text green working.

00:57:58
<transcript>: it might be working

00:57:59
<transcript>: It might be working.

00:58:01
<transcript>: Notice that.

00:58:09
<transcript>: Now text screens also not working. Nothing is overriding. Okay? I don't know why we have that working last week. I know we did.

00:58:13
<transcript>: I don't know how we were doing it differently.

00:58:18
<transcript>: We could pass to the button itself. We could pass like.

00:58:23
<transcript>: Correct.

00:58:31
<transcript>: Pass all that state into the button. But then this button becomes not general purpose. I guess it kind of is general purpose. I guess.

00:58:42
<transcript>: Because they can be optional. You don't have to pass all that stuff in and by default it just behaves the way you'd expect the Orange. Yeah, we're gonna just do that. That's fine.

00:58:42
<transcript>: so

00:58:48
<transcript>: So instead of having all these classes outside, I was trying to keep this button more general purpose.

00:58:48
<transcript>: and not

00:58:53
<transcript>: And not just this game state stuff, but I think we can I think we can safely.

00:58:53
<transcript>: roll

00:58:56
<transcript>: Roll this state into the component.

00:59:01
<transcript>: Okay so button is going to take in.

00:59:01
<transcript>: the

00:59:07
<transcript>: The whatever it needs here correct and incorrect. I guess so it's got in here.

00:59:08
aliwolfi1: when to use trpc and when to use graphql ?!

00:59:09
<transcript>: We're gonna do.

00:59:11
<transcript>: Button, props.

00:59:11
<transcript>: equals

00:59:13
<transcript>: Equals.

00:59:15
<transcript>: No sorry type.

00:59:15
<transcript>: button

00:59:18
<transcript>: Button, props.

00:59:23
<transcript>: Interface.

00:59:28
<transcript>: Component.

00:59:37
<transcript>: Okay, we're gonna add.

00:59:38
<transcript>: Correct.

00:59:42
<transcript>: Incorrect.

00:59:50
<transcript>: This is gonna be button, props.

00:59:59
<transcript>: There should be undefined by default.

01:00:05
<transcript>: Sorry, delete.

01:00:09
<transcript>: Okay.

01:00:13
<transcript>: So boolean are undefined.

01:00:19
<transcript>: So here we're going to strip out.

01:00:23
<transcript>: The colors like the border. Orange, nine.

01:00:26
<transcript>: And the background blue.

01:00:30
<transcript>: Three background we're gonna leave always defaulted.

01:00:30
<transcript>: there's like

01:00:33
<transcript>: There's like text Orange sign. Maybe.

01:00:35
<transcript>: Yeah, Yeah.

01:00:39
<transcript>: True.

01:00:42
<transcript>: Okay.

01:00:42
<transcript>: so these

01:00:44
<transcript>: So these are gonna be.

01:00:44
<transcript>: not specified

01:00:46
<transcript>: Not specified here.

01:00:49
<transcript>: Tx okay.

01:00:49
<transcript>: these are gonna be

01:00:50
<transcript>: These are gonna be.

01:00:50
<transcript>: let's see it's gonna

01:00:52
<transcript>: Let's see it's gonna be.

01:00:52
<transcript>: not earth

01:00:54
<transcript>: Not Earth can be correct.

01:00:56
<transcript>: Equals undefined.

01:00:56
<transcript>: and

01:00:58
<transcript>: And incorrect.

01:00:58
<transcript>: equ

01:01:01
<transcript>: Equals undefined.

01:01:01
datsycko: where is that cn function from ?

01:01:06
<transcript>: Importantly not checking if they're false.

01:01:08
<transcript>: If they're false, that's a different thing.

01:01:15
<transcript>: Right. So. Well, wait a minute. Why do I have two flags that are the inverse of each other? That's dumb.

01:01:17
<transcript>: That's done.

01:01:25
<transcript>: Why are they not the inverse of each other? Correct is if answer equals the name incorrect is chosen.

01:01:25
<transcript>: and

01:01:29
<transcript>: And choice equals name. Okay, so we're saying.

01:01:35
<transcript>: Why can direct my head around that let's state right now.

01:01:42
<transcript>: Ally Woof Win to use TrpC and when to use GraphQL.

01:01:46
<transcript>: I'm not a.

01:01:58
<transcript>: Trpc expert yet. I've not used it that much. I mean, this project is my first exposure. I mean, it's not my first exposure. It's my first, really, like trying to use it on a project.

01:01:58
<transcript>: i've been exposed

01:02:05
<transcript>: I've been exposed to it for a while, and I'm aware of the concept in the tradeoffs somewhat, but I would say.

01:02:08
<transcript>: I think I think do did a video on this.

01:02:16
<transcript>: Which I haven't seen, but I would recommend to go check that out. Like GraphQL versus other stuff.

01:02:19
<transcript>: My General. Heuristic would be.

01:02:19
<transcript>: you

01:02:22
<transcript>: You sort of like, get to a point where you need more control.

01:02:22
<transcript>: and use

01:02:24
<transcript>: And use GraphQL.

01:02:24
<transcript>: but i

01:02:31
<transcript>: But I don't know that TrpC and especially version Ten doesn't cover all your bases. Like I don't know that you can't get.

01:02:31
<transcript>: to the same

01:02:38
<transcript>: To the same place as with PrPC. I just don't know enough about the tradeoffs, probably to comment on it, but I would check out the O's video and I'm sure there's other stuff on YouTube.

01:02:43
neochromer: I worked with GRPC and I loved it

01:02:45
<transcript>: Where is that CN function from that's class names. It's a.

01:02:45
<transcript>: it

01:02:51
aliwolfi1: tthanks

01:02:52
<transcript>: It's a it's just a MP module called class names, and it basically just takes in an object like that.

01:02:58
<transcript>: Where is it? Right here. Takes in an object that you can like. Conditionally. Include classes.

01:02:58
<transcript>: or you

01:03:03
<transcript>: Or you can just pass an array of strings and it can catch them all.

01:03:06
<transcript>: It works in a couple different ways.

01:03:06
<transcript>: okay so we're

01:03:12
<transcript>: Okay. So we're gonna pass correct and incorrect. I'm just gonna copy all this stuff.

01:03:17
<transcript>: And put it down here.

01:03:21
datsycko: ah got it, thanks! looks useful

01:03:26
<transcript>: And then correct and incorrect. It's going to add those in the class at 30.

01:03:28
<transcript>: So correct.

01:03:30
<transcript>: That looks good.

01:03:36
<transcript>: I guess I could do the same thing with the focus States.

01:03:38
<transcript>: In the Hover States.

01:03:38
<transcript>: instead

01:03:40
<transcript>: Instead of define them like this.

01:03:42
<transcript>: You got to find them here. Yeah.

01:03:42
<transcript>: let's just

01:03:47
<transcript>: Let's just see if this works, so correct and correct. We need to pass them into the button.

01:03:47
<transcript>: we need to get rid

01:03:50
<transcript>: We need to get rid of all of this.

01:03:55
<transcript>: Right.

01:03:59
<transcript>: Relative with full and.

01:03:59
<transcript>: medium

01:04:02
<transcript>: Medium as a width of 64 okay.

01:04:06
<transcript>: I'm gonna pass.

01:04:06
<transcript>: correct

01:04:07
<transcript>: Correct.

01:04:12
<transcript>: And incorrect.

01:04:18
<transcript>: Oh.

01:04:21
<transcript>: What's going on here.

01:04:25
<transcript>: So Let's.

01:04:25
<transcript>: log

01:04:26
<transcript>: Log.

01:04:29
<transcript>: Console, log.

01:04:32
<transcript>: Correct.

01:04:47
<transcript>: I don't know if you noticed, but we're listening to some different music today, not just playing all day, on repeat.

01:04:55
<transcript>: Trying a new playlist that I put together. It's just like a bunch of stuff from my musical history, things that I've liked over the years.

01:04:55
<transcript>: it's gonna be

01:04:56
<transcript>: It's gonna be varied.

01:04:56
<transcript>: this is some andrew

01:04:58
<transcript>: This is some Andrew bird. Probably.

01:05:03
<transcript>: Yeah. It's gonna be a lot of stuff.

01:05:06
<transcript>: Let me know what you like what you don't like.

01:05:08
<transcript>: You can remove stuff.

01:05:12
<transcript>: Breakfast. False. Incorrect is false. So.

01:05:12
<transcript>: they're not

01:05:13
<transcript>: They're not.

01:05:13
<transcript>: undefined

01:05:15
<transcript>: Undefined.

01:05:16
<transcript>: How widow.

01:05:22
<transcript>: They would only be undefined if no, there would never be undefined.

01:05:22
<transcript>: why did i

01:05:24
<transcript>: Why did I think these could be undefined.

01:05:28
<transcript>: That is only a boolean. Same with that one. Okay.

01:05:32
<transcript>: Well, that was an incorrect assumption.

01:05:40
<transcript>: I guess we could change this here, but it just doesn't seem right.

01:05:44
<transcript>: Doesn't seem right.

01:05:52
<transcript>: Let's try it. This is Kinesis. Some of something. Yeah.

01:05:58
<transcript>: Still doesn't work. Oh, there we go. It's just the focus day doesn't work. Okay. Okay.

01:06:04
<transcript>: Firewall? What is that.

01:06:04
<transcript>: not

01:06:09
<transcript>: Not last system manager really looks like a network e thing.

01:06:11
<transcript>: What is this one.

01:06:14
<transcript>: Voice connector.

01:06:14
<transcript>: now migration

01:06:20
<transcript>: Now migration hub. I'm bad at this game. I'm bad at my own game. There's just too many AWS services. What is that.

01:06:20
<transcript>: it's something

01:06:22
<transcript>: It's something compute. Because it's Orange.

01:06:31
<transcript>: What? I have no idea. Look out for equipment. Nimble Studio. Maybe. Nimble suit. Yeah. Okay.

01:06:38
schrew: gm! wtf is lookout for equipment, lol

01:06:38
<transcript>: Worked with gRPC. And I loved it.

01:06:42
<transcript>: Neocromer. I don't know if I'd seen you yet today.

01:06:42
<transcript>: my neocromer

01:06:44
<transcript>: My neocromer.

01:06:44
<transcript>: good morning

01:06:45
<transcript>: Good morning. Shrew.

01:06:46
neochromer: Nope I just lurking

01:06:48
neochromer: this morning :D

01:06:56
<transcript>: Yeah. What is lookout for equipment. I have no idea. I love the aid of his services that have a physical component. Like snowmobile. Where like a semi truck will pull up to your establishment.

01:06:56
<transcript>: so

01:06:58
<transcript>: So you can load date on it.

01:06:58
<transcript>: that's awesome

01:07:03
<transcript>: That's awesome. Like you can, you can literally order a semitruck from AWS.

01:07:03
<transcript>: that's cool

01:07:07
<transcript>: That's cool snowballs are much more practical and affordable.

01:07:09
stroopwafel26: @Schrew it's an industrial systems monitoring service

01:07:11
<transcript>: Like a little like Brief and a briefcase. They're like a big.

01:07:11
<transcript>: compute box

01:07:22
<transcript>: Compute box that you can load a bunch of stuff on so you can send it to the data center to be loaded in S three. When you have so much data that like doing it over the network would take forever. You order a snowball.

01:07:22
<transcript>: and

01:07:32
<transcript>: And the I love the names of those services like they're all the Snow family. Snowball and snowmobile. What's the other one? There's another snow. One.

01:07:37
stroopwafel26: we use it at a client that's based in the biggest port in Europe (Rotterdam, NL)

01:07:37
schrew: snowcone

01:07:40
<transcript>: But yes, no mobile is they're gonna back up a semi to wherever you are. Don't order it from home.

01:07:40
<transcript>: unless they've

01:07:48
<transcript>: Unless they've got good access, and then you're gonna load date onto that thing by the Petabyte and ship it off to S Three. That's so cool.

01:07:51
<transcript>: Does anything of snow cone. Thank you. Shrew.

01:07:51
<transcript>: does

01:07:59
<transcript>: Does any other cloud provider have that like a similar service where you can order a semitruck to load data.

01:07:59
<transcript>: i doubt it

01:08:01
<transcript>: I doubt it.

01:08:04
<transcript>: That's possible. But I doubt it.

01:08:11
<transcript>: 's an Industry Systems Monitoring service.

01:08:17
<transcript>: We use it as a client that's based in the biggest part of Europe. Runner name. Okay, interesting. Look out for equipment.

01:08:23
<transcript>: Oh. So it's not like, okay. Yeah. So it's like a service that's watching.

01:08:23
<transcript>: your

01:08:24
<transcript>: Your.

01:08:24
<transcript>: physical system

01:08:28
deadrobotdev: Does any other service have so many services that there is enough content for a guessing game? LUL

01:08:31
<transcript>: Physical systems. It's not like you should start looking out for equipment. That's what I thought of it like, look out for a semitruck. It's coming.

01:08:40
<transcript>: Welcome to my Chat Dead Robot. Does any other service have so many services that there's enough content for guessing game? Probably not.

01:08:47
<transcript>: Yeah, probably not. Like, I don't know how many times I've seen the same service twice. And we've played this a little bit on stream.

01:08:47
<transcript>: like

01:08:50
<transcript>: Like, what is this? This is IQ.

01:08:50
<transcript>: one of my favorite

01:08:53
<transcript>: One of my favorite services. It's time to make a living.

01:08:53
<transcript>: okay

01:08:59
stroopwafel26: you can find anomalies in industrial systems and catch faults before they happen

01:09:01
<transcript>: Okay, so what's wrong here? We've got the focus state problem. That's a problem. I don't like this. I don't like passing correct and incorrect. That's such a dumb.

01:09:01
<transcript>: like

01:09:03
<transcript>: Like.

01:09:03
<transcript>: you would

01:09:07
<transcript>: You would think correct was to be the opposite of incorrect.

01:09:07
<transcript>: and they're not

01:09:16
<transcript>: And they're not. And I got to figure out why I think the I'm mixing I'm conflating some terms here, right? Like I'm conflating.

01:09:21
<transcript>: Correctness with like how I want to style my buttons and that's not really.

01:09:26
<transcript>: There already is a result. That correct. I think right result.

01:09:26
<transcript>: correct

01:09:28
deadrobotdev: Hi! Found you via Jamie talking about your keyboard, and Benja's chat.

01:09:35
<transcript>: Correct. Yeah. So correct is just like a property on the response. I'm creating some other thing, and I'm calling it correct. But that's not really.

01:09:39
<transcript>: It's okay. So it's because.

01:09:39
<transcript>: your answer

01:09:41
<transcript>: Your answer could be correct.

01:09:41
<transcript>: but

01:09:47
<transcript>: But we're dealing with each individual button. Is this button the correct answer.

01:09:47
<transcript>: versus

01:09:48
<transcript>: Versus.

01:09:48
<transcript>: the answer

01:09:51
bajosi: correct: true | false | null ?

01:09:57
<transcript>: The answer you specify was correct. So there's two different things. We need to rename these and think about this a little differently. Thank you for the follow. The slow.

01:09:57
<transcript>: div

01:09:57
<transcript>: Div.

01:10:04
<transcript>: Hi found you via Jamie talking about your keyboard and Binge's chat.

01:10:04
<transcript>: i've seen

01:10:11
<transcript>: I've seen you somewhere. Dead robots. I knew I had seen you somewhere. Is that from Binge's Chat? That's where I'd seen you. I like Ben Jeff.

01:10:11
<transcript>: like j

01:10:13
deadrobotdev: I mod for Benja, yeah

01:10:14
<transcript>: Like Jamie, too.

01:10:14
<transcript>: you guys

01:10:21
<transcript>: You guys find anomalies and industrial systems and catch faults before they happen. That's super interesting Stroop. I might pick your brain about that later.

01:10:35
<transcript>: You mod for binge it. I gotcha okay. I was seeing the other day. How nobody I don't mod for anybody that bothers me. I mean, I've been on Twitter, like two months, so I guess I haven't earned enough goodwill, but I got an email from Twitch that was like.

01:10:35
<transcript>: here's

01:10:46
<transcript>: Here's your new sword. You're a moderator or something. And I think it was just from my own channel. And I don't know why they sent me an email about it, but I was like Scouring Twitch, trying to figure out who modded me, who let me be their moderator. I'm so excited.

01:10:54
<transcript>: But Jokesie. Welcome to Chat. What is that? Patch Twittzcon 2020 correct true, false or null.

01:10:54
<transcript>: yeah

01:10:55
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:10:55
<transcript>: i

01:10:58
<transcript>: I think the one on answer.

01:11:01
<transcript>: Let's see here. Let's.

01:11:03
<transcript>: Result is a result.

01:11:08
<transcript>: Game answer? Oh, yeah, yeah? So it's in our game.

01:11:13
<transcript>: I think it can be null, right? No.

01:11:15
<transcript>: Correct.

01:11:15
<transcript>: is a bully

01:11:17
<transcript>: Is a bullying. No, it's just true or false.

01:11:19
<transcript>: I just did this.

01:11:19
<transcript>: dumbly

01:11:23
<transcript>: Dumbly. This is not a good way to do it right.

01:11:27
neochromer: @adamdotdev is there a reason you don't do CTRL D in nvim

01:11:28
<transcript>: But what we're trying to do is style each bite button, based on what.

01:11:28
<transcript>: it was

01:11:29
neochromer: for scrolling?

01:11:39
deadrobotdev: "Hey, you made yourself moderator of your own chat. SeemsGood "

01:11:45
<transcript>: It was the answer chosen whether you clicked on that one and whether you got it right or wrong, because if you click on the right one, we don't style all the wrong ones to show that they're wrong. But if you click on the wrong one, we style the right one to show that it's right. Does that make sense? There's a lot of words.

01:11:50
<transcript>: Is there a reason you don't control T.

01:11:56
<transcript>: Yeah, there's a reason.

01:11:58
<transcript>: I just can't get used to it.

01:12:16
deadrobotdev: The mod stuff has definitely improved over the past couple of years. Mod view is so nice.

01:12:17
<transcript>: I want to. I aspire to be a control up and Downer. I do. But for some reason, I end up just Jang. I just constantly. I need to slow down, you know? It is. And it slow down. My repeat. That's what I need to do. My key repeat is too fast because it's fast enough that I'm always like, oh, this is getting me there.

01:12:17
<transcript>: it's not that

01:12:23
neochromer: haha :D

01:12:24
<transcript>: It's not that fast enough. I need to slow. Let's just do it right now. I'm gonna slow it down, and I'm gonna take a quick break. Let's see what's this gonna do. Pull up.

01:12:26
<transcript>: Keyboard.

01:12:40
stroopwafel26: Look at that Ventura system settings

01:12:42
<transcript>: Key, repeat rate. Look at that all the way up. That's the problem. If we turn that down, it's gonna drive me crazy, and I will have to start page upping and Downings. So let's see. Oh, look, that is that serious.

01:12:45
<transcript>: Is that seriously how slow it is now.

01:12:48
<transcript>: Oh, that's two. That's too far.

01:12:50
<transcript>: This is way too far.

01:12:52
<transcript>: Let's split the difference. Maybe.

01:12:54
deadrobotdev: LUL

01:12:55
<transcript>: Keyboard.

01:13:11
<transcript>: Let's split the difference. Maybe. Like, I don't know. Here. I guess I want it to be annoying, but there's gonna be other times when I'm trying to repeat a key, and I'm really frustrated. Okay, now I will have to page up and down. Thank you. You reminded me. We need to fix that. We fixed it.

01:13:21
parcodek: Hey, saw you in akawr's discord!

01:13:27
laytanl_: You also don't use '/' or '?' a lot

01:13:32
<transcript>: Yeah, Vinterior system settings. I did. I switched over. I have no chill. I just someone's like, hey, here's some beta software. It's half Bake. It'll break. Definitely will break. I'm like, yes, please give it to me. I run everything on beta. I'm so dumb. It's dumb. They're like, don't do this on your main machine. I'm like, who has two machines? I've one machine. I'm gonna do it on it. Deal with it.

01:13:33
laytanl_: which are great to make big jumps

01:13:36
<transcript>: Don't use a slash or question a lot. Yeah. No, I don't.

01:13:43
<transcript>: You saw me Paracode. You saw me in a car's discord. That's right. I joined a car's discord.

01:13:43
<transcript>: oh that's another

01:13:47
<transcript>: Oh, that's another thing I want to talk about. I am I'm adding. I'm creating.

01:13:47
<transcript>: a new

01:13:52
<transcript>: A new discord server I don't know if I'm gonna convert the one that I have currently.

01:13:52
<transcript>: or just

01:13:58
<transcript>: Or just create a new one, but it's watch Dev. Oh, you want to see the logo? Because of course, I had David make a logo.

01:13:58
<transcript>: oh oh yeah

01:14:05
<transcript>: Oh, oh, yeah. I did the donation, and we'll talk about the job. I just don't want to hurt you. Signal, so I'm trying to avoid too much of that, okay.

01:14:05
<transcript>: this

01:14:18
ohmymndy: Who is that dope dude over here smoking~?

01:14:24
deadrobotdev: LUL I do the same thing. Running an experimental shell and accidentally deleted two folders because of an error when you rename a folder to lowercase on Windows.

01:14:25
<transcript>: This is the Watch Dev logo. David designed some. We're just trying to side color. Maybe you guys want to vote watch that Dev is just I want to have a different channel where there are people from Twitch chat that I can hang out with when I'm not streaming because I'm gonna be streaming even less with the two days a week thing. So I want to have a place off of Stream to hang out right.

01:14:25
<transcript>: natural

01:14:26
<transcript>: Natural.

01:14:26
<transcript>: but it feels

01:14:32
<transcript>: But it feels very weird to have a Twitch or a discord server that's like Adam.

01:14:32
<transcript>: here's

01:14:39
<transcript>: Here's. Adam's Discord Server. It's like there's enough discoursers in the world to not have one centered around me individually. This feels weird.

01:14:39
<transcript>: so

01:14:59
<transcript>: So I talked with Aaron Francis, who's like Alarabel Dev. He works for Plant Scale. Now he's a BA at Plants. Go, I think he's a DA. I don't know. I could be wrong. His title. I'm not sure. Thanks for the follow dead robot. I appreciate it. So. Oh, don't you see Mandy? Mandy's here. That super juice. That's me. I'm smoking. I didn't even realize I had this on deal with it.

01:15:01
stroopwafel26: The purple one is awesome

01:15:20
<transcript>: So Aaron, Francis and I are kind of starting this whole Watch Dev idea, and it's just a discord server for people who want to watch developer stream and developers who want to stream but don't want to have their own discord servers. So you'll just have, like a channel or a folder in the server. It's like the Atom Dev channel, and you can go in there if you want to talk about my stream.

01:15:20
<transcript>: but like

01:15:25
<transcript>: But like it's a one service for multiple devs just to use and kind of share.

01:15:25
<transcript>: if that makes sense

01:15:27
<transcript>: If that makes sense.

01:15:32
ohmymndy: Great initiative, I can't handle all the different discord servers, but I want to keep in touch with dev's and such

01:15:34
parcodek: I like the red one better

01:15:35
<transcript>: I don't know. I don't have, like, it's not gonna be a business. There's not gonna be any. It's just gonna be like, watch that, Davis. Literally. You're gonna redirect to the discord server.

01:15:35
<transcript>: and

01:15:38
<transcript>: And that's gonna be it so there you're.

01:15:42
<transcript>: Having color preferences. Red one. Okay. There we go.

01:15:44
<transcript>: Let me catch up here on chat.

01:15:46
waldirborbajr: I have a custom map like ThePrimeagen, to keep cursos at the middle of screen on page UP/Down  -- Page up/down and recenter at middle key_mapper('n', '<C-d>', '<C-d> | zz') key_mapper('n', '<C-u>', '<C-u> | zz')

01:15:54
<transcript>: You also don't use yeah late yeah, I don't search very much do what's question Mark, dude, do what's question Mark? Do I don't even know.

01:15:55
deadrobotdev: That'd be great, especially as a lot of dev Discord servers have the same kinda channels. Help, Resources, etc.

01:16:00
laytanl_: searches back

01:16:03
s1hofmann: Hey Adam, your new stream schedule is awesome for EU people :)

01:16:05
<transcript>: I don't even know. Welcome back, Mandy. It's good to see you. It's good to see you all today. I feel like streaming every five days is gonna just kill me. I'm dying inside.

01:16:05
laytanl_: reverse of '/'

01:16:11
ohmymndy: Talking about The Primeagen, I have a Kinesis Advantage 2 LF

01:16:14
<transcript>: Running a shirt shall actually do two folders because the air when you're near a folder to locate on Windows. Oh no, we live on the bleeding edge. Dead robot.

01:16:24
mow_mi_wilku: I haven't seen more cool and open-minded person than Adam in my entire life

01:16:30
<transcript>: Purple ones. We got a vote for purple. One can't handle all the different discourses. I want to keep in touch with Devs. Yeah. Thank you, Mandy. That's. That's how I feel. I can't handle all the servers. And I hate having one named Adam and friends because I just don't think there needs to be a server about me.

01:16:30
<transcript>: so we

01:16:34
<transcript>: So we got a vote for red, we have a vote for purple.

01:16:36
laytanl_: Purple or orange for me

01:16:43
laytanl_: or is it red

01:16:52
deadrobotdev: @laytanl_ Literally me LUL

01:16:54
<transcript>: Custom map, like the prime agent to keep cursors at the middle of screen. Oh, I do that, too. I do, ZZ. So let's see here. So if I'm like, way down here. Oh, it's so slow. I have to page down now. Oh, no, it's gonna be slow. Oh, I can just tap it. Yeah. So ZZ brings it to the middle. That feels good. Oh, wow. We fixed my J problem, people. We really did it.

01:16:57
<transcript>: I'm gonna have to do this now.

01:16:59
<transcript>: Just gonna have to.

01:17:01
<transcript>: I.

01:17:04
stroopwafel26: purple aligns with twitch and discord colors :P

01:17:17
ohmymndy: Haha, switch ma J problem, you smoking one right now

01:17:21
<transcript>: 've discord servers have the same kind of channels. Help resource. Exactly. I don't know. We can have, like, we can have folders or channels for different languages. And like, if somebody's streaming about language, you could call it out there. And like, you know, hey, if you want to learn about Rust, go watch DINJA today or whatever.

01:17:26
<transcript>: Search is backward. Thank you late. And so question Mark searches backwards. Good to know. Okay.

01:17:26
<transcript>: huffman

01:17:30
<transcript>: Huffman. Your new screen schedule is awesome for EU people. It is.

01:17:30
<transcript>: i thought it was

01:17:46
<transcript>: I thought it was gonna be worse. I was worried that I guess moving it back an hour or two is really just the Oceana, like Southeast Asia. I guess that's where, like my Australian friends won't be able to watch as easily. It'll be too late. I'm guessing.

01:17:47
deadrobotdev: Yeah, Purple

01:17:51
<transcript>: But yeah, I guess in the EU, it still works. Still works for you all.

01:17:53
s1hofmann: Well, it's 1pm for me, not too bad

01:17:54
tayloreddev: I like that discord idea

01:17:56
<transcript>: Talking about the Prime Jen. I have a Kinesis advantage, too.

01:17:56
<transcript>: do you really

01:18:04
<transcript>: Do you really? Mandy? I ordered the Advantage 360 or whatever. Is that the one you're talking about? What's? Lf.

01:18:05
ohmymndy: I am biased, cause Ireally like orange, like the left one

01:18:10
<transcript>: I ordered the Advanced 360, but I have heard when they're gonna send it. I don't know when I get it.

01:18:10

<transcript>: Are you kidding me.

01:18:19
<transcript>: i'm

01:18:23

01:18:27
<transcript>: I'm openminded. I don't even know am I am I an open minded person.

01:18:27
<transcript>: purple

<transcript>: So just not which one did you not say.

01:18:39
<transcript>: or you're saying

01:18:49
<transcript>: Or you're saying, is it red? Is the purple one or the Orange one, red. Oh, they're too similar for you. Yeah. Yeah. So say, one, two, three, or four, maybe. Maybe. Just position them.

01:18:54
<transcript>: Purple does align with Twitch and discord? That's true. Oh, that's a good point.

01:18:55
laytanl_: 1 or 3

01:18:58
<transcript>: Switch with J problem. You smoking one right now.

01:18:58
<transcript>: what

01:19:00
<transcript>: What.

s1hofmann: Count me in on the Discord, been looking for smth like this!

01:19:54

<transcript>: Discord and Twitch.

01:20:08
<transcript>: Cool, Hoffman. Okay, you all are in for it, either. We're gonna convert the current Atom server, which used to be the AWS FA server. That one's either. Just gonna get converted.

<transcript>: But he'll take criticism. If you don't like something, let us know. I like this whole dot in the middle thing. I really like it.

<transcript>: I also just have a lot of Dev domains so I can use this logo for like everything.

01:20:39
<transcript>: he did it

01:20:42

01:38:51
<transcript>: sapaz

01:38:54
<transcript>: Sapaz Screen Music Doing it for you.

01:38:58
<transcript>: Okay.

01:38:58
<transcript>: what were we doing

01:39:00
<transcript>: What were we doing.

01:39:03
<transcript>: What were we doing? What were we doing.

01:39:05
<transcript>: Let's just go back to doing this.

01:39:05
<transcript>: whatever we were doing

01:39:07
<transcript>: Whatever we were doing.

01:39:23
<transcript>: So what are we trying to do here.

01:39:23
<transcript>: what we're

01:39:36
<transcript>: What we're trying to do. These are really, like, more styling associated. Oh, look at that. Repeat it's so slow. That way too. I'm gonna have to get good at them. I love it. So I'm gonna have to be like, oh, I want to go back to that R know that one.

01:39:36
<transcript>: yeah

01:39:37
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay.

01:39:37
<transcript>: all right

01:39:42
<transcript>: All right, we're all in now. We got rid of that fast key. Repeat.

01:39:47
<transcript>: Now we have to do the real way. So this isn't correct. This is.

01:39:47
<transcript>: let's call it

01:39:48
<transcript>: Let's call it.

01:39:59
<transcript>: Green. I mean, really, it's like a styling related thing, right? Like, we want it to be green.

01:39:59
<transcript>: if

01:40:01
<transcript>: If the answer.

01:40:01
<transcript>: is equal

01:40:03
<transcript>: Is equal to the name.

01:40:06
<transcript>: So whether they chose it or not.

01:40:06
<transcript>: we're always gonna

01:40:10
<transcript>: We're always gonna style the correct one. Green, right.

01:40:12
<transcript>: Right.

01:40:15
<transcript>: So in that sense.

01:40:26
<transcript>: We could do this the right way. So if we go down here button, I'm gonna try and do this the right way, and then people.

01:40:26
<transcript>: i feel bad

01:40:30
<transcript>: I feel bad. It how you feel about me doing stuff and then the right way.

01:40:34
<transcript>: So I think we can style this now.

01:40:40
<transcript>: Slowness and vim.

01:40:40
<transcript>: exposed

01:40:41
<transcript>: Exposed.

01:40:43
<transcript>: Has been exposed.

01:40:48
<transcript>: So this should be what's do like success.

01:40:52
<transcript>: Or Noble do like a state.

01:40:56
<transcript>: Right. And it'll be like.

01:40:56
<transcript>: success

01:40:57
<transcript>: Success.

01:40:57
<transcript>: or

01:40:59
<transcript>: Or.

01:41:05
<transcript>: Error now. Yeah, we'll have like an error state, I guess.

01:41:10
<transcript>: Hear me out.

01:41:14
nate_codes: YOOO ADAM WELL TIMED TWEET MY GUY!

01:41:21
<transcript>: Okay. So now instead of this, it's going to be.

01:41:24
<transcript>: State is null.

01:41:26
<transcript>: State equals.

01:41:28
<transcript>: Undefined.

01:41:28
<transcript>: right

01:41:30
<transcript>: Right.

01:41:34
<transcript>: Okay. And then this is going to be.

01:41:35
nate_codes: Toddler just woke us up w/ a fever. Opened Twitter on the pot and saw you still streaming

01:41:36
<transcript>: State.

01:41:38
<transcript>: Equals correct.

01:41:42
<transcript>: I'm not even like.

01:41:44
<transcript>: What's wrong with that.

01:41:49
<transcript>: Oh, it's not correct. Success.

01:41:51
nate_codes: All thanks to a serendipitously timed tweet

01:42:01
<transcript>: This is just like coloring the button to be a successor and error state. Whoa, what happened here.

01:42:04
<transcript>: What happened here.

01:42:04
<transcript>: do that

01:42:06
<transcript>: Do that. That was weird.

01:42:14
<transcript>: Nate codes. Well, time. Tweet. Hey, Toddler. Just woke up with a fever.

01:42:14
<transcript>: open twitter

01:42:15
stroopwafel26: oh no, toddlers with a fever :(

01:42:17
<transcript>: Open Twitter on the pot and saw you still streaming.

01:42:19
<transcript>: That's awesome.

01:42:19
<transcript>: i'm glad

01:42:21
<transcript>: I'm glad I tweeted.

01:42:25
<transcript>: Welcome, Nate. Welcome. Good to see you.

01:42:44
<transcript>: So good to see you. I don't feel like you're. Yeah. I don't feel like you make my stream very often. We interact a lot on Twitter and elsewhere, but my stream times are getting later and later. I'm pushed it back. Now it's like seven to eleven Eastern, so I feel like I'm actually gonna build interact with some US folks, maybe even an early riser on the West Coast.

01:42:48
<transcript>: Do any West Coasters wake up before 09:00 a.m.. I don't know, do they.

01:42:51
<transcript>: That's my joke.

01:42:51
<transcript>: i've worked with

01:42:57
jackysono: Yeah but only to surf

01:42:58
nate_codes: Yeah your stream times never quite line up lol

01:42:59
<transcript>: I've worked with a lot of West Coast Coasters, and they weren't early risers. Could it just be a small sample size? Could just be a small sample size? I shouldn't just them all.

01:42:59
<transcript>: but

01:43:09
nate_codes: I wake up 5-6 most days

01:43:12
<transcript>: But my favorite is when you interact with someone in California, and it's like, I don't know, after lunch, it's 01:00 and they're like, good morning. And I'm like, that morning anywhere in the world, but where you live.

01:43:15
<transcript>: Five to six.

01:43:15
<transcript>: are

01:43:17
<transcript>: Are you on the West Coast? Nate.

01:43:17
<transcript>: was i just making

01:43:17
beardage: 5:30am here haha

01:43:20
<transcript>: Was I just making fun of West Coast, and it was you.

01:43:27
<transcript>: 're 05:30 a.m. Look at you waking up on the West Coast at 530.

01:43:37
beardage: this guy

01:43:40
<transcript>: You all early rise in just after I as soon as I said that West Coasters just sleep in. I guess we would have some bias here in this stream if you're awake on the West Coast and you're here.

01:43:47
<transcript>: If you're asleep on the West Coast, you wouldn't be here. So I guess most of the people in Chat would be awake.

01:43:50
nate_codes: Crazy thing was when I traveled to east coast and stayed waking up at 5…then got back and was waking up at 2am KEKW

01:43:50
shn4ke: 5:30 am t3ggWave

01:43:51
<transcript>: West Coasters if you're from West Coast, okay.

01:43:57
<transcript>: Stream only to surf. To surf? Are you a surfer? Jackie sauna.

01:43:59
nate_codes: Yes I’m west coast lol

01:44:03
<transcript>: That's the only reason you wake up is that what you're saying.

01:44:07
<transcript>: That's the only reason you'd get up early on the West Coast is to surf.

01:44:10
<transcript>: That's awesome.

01:44:22
<transcript>: Nate is West Coast. Okay, so I just. I just made fun. Nice snake. Look at all you west coasters, you early risers. You're probably all Gin Z. That's the thing. Millennials on the West Coast. Sleep in.

01:44:22
<transcript>: genzee though

01:44:24
vishuripforgames: Do something fun with react.

01:44:26
<transcript>: Genzee, though genzee's different you guys.

01:44:26
<transcript>: i don't know

01:44:31
<transcript>: I don't know. I'm pretty positive I'm bullish on the future of the world because of Genesis.

01:44:40
<transcript>: You guys, you just do something fun with react. Well, Vishir. I don't know if it's fun, but this is react. We are doing something.

01:44:43
nate_codes: Gen Z early risers KEKW

01:44:48
<transcript>: We're building. Aw, guess it's for fun. So I think a textbook, your boxes, it's react, and it's for fun.

01:44:49
<transcript>: Ginsey.

01:44:49
<transcript>: you guys

01:44:58
<transcript>: You guys, you blow me away a little bit more every day. I keep meeting you 21 year olds that have done more than I've done in my 36 years.

01:44:58
<transcript>: and then

01:45:03
nate_codes: I’m a millennial try again bud

01:45:06
<transcript>: And then I learned there's a book about this phenomenon that, like generations are maturing earlier and like generally.

01:45:06
<transcript>: skipping

01:45:06
ohmymndy: As a millenial, what is kekw?

01:45:13
ohmymndy: Is that poggers?

01:45:16
2dorkstv: dude, right. gen-z crushing it

01:45:17
<transcript>: Skipping lots of years of wasted time that we didn't skip. We just rolled right through it as millennials. We would wasted that time. I feel I seriously, am I in my twenty s. I don't know if I did anything in my 20s. Like anything.

01:45:23
<transcript>: I really am struggling. I guess we started Stat Muse in our late 20s.

01:45:30
<transcript>: Yeah. I guess I started saying he's like 28. So like, my 28 was like a gymsy or 18.

01:45:36
<transcript>: Yeah, ginsenuts.

01:45:39
<transcript>: Is a Millennial. What is.

01:45:50
ogjake: you made statmuse.com?

01:45:57
<transcript>: Why do I not? Why do I not see that as the emote? Donna, have the right plugins or extensions or something? I need Ginsee to explain this to me. I don't see the kick W one as an Emote. I know that's short for something. I thought it was like seven TV, but I don't see it. I thought I had seven TV.

01:46:01
<transcript>: I made stat muse.com ogjake. That's right.

01:46:01
<transcript>: kham

01:46:02
parcodek: damn, i started coding at 11 lol

01:46:05
<transcript>: Khamj, Jason, Chad, Chat. Maybe. Still. I don't know if J Stations still here.

01:46:05
ogjake: wow thats sick

01:46:08
beardage: you need better twitch tv extension

01:46:11
parcodek: genz for the win

01:46:14
<transcript>: Welcome. Wait. You're not new to chat? Jake. You're. Jake. Jake. Jake. Am I not following Jake.

01:46:23
<transcript>: Now I can't go to the little Hover. All I can see is the J cover. Now.

01:46:23
<transcript>: which is

01:46:26
shn4ke: you can add ffz as chrome ext and see bttv, ffz and 7tv emotes

01:46:27
<transcript>: Which is great, but like I would like to see Chat. Oh.

01:46:27
<transcript>: well

01:46:30
<transcript>: Well, it's a Zoom out or something.

01:46:36
<transcript>: No. Still, just see the J cover. I'm gonna refresh the page. That's how far we've gone.

01:46:36
<transcript>: it's how bad it

01:46:38
<transcript>: It's. How bad it's gotten.

01:46:39
ogjake: lol, yeah sorry just got a dog so haven't been in the streams as much lately but def try to hop in when I can

01:46:40
<transcript>: There we go.

01:46:43
<transcript>: Gen Z for the win.

01:46:45
<transcript>: wine better

01:46:45
<transcript>: wine better twitch

01:46:49
<transcript>: Wine better Twitch TV, better Twitch TV extension. I thought I had that.

01:46:49
<transcript>: i guess

01:46:51
<transcript>: I guess I don't.

01:46:51
<transcript>: fs

01:46:54
<transcript>: Fsz is Chrome extensions BTT.

01:47:00
ogjake: Did you get the stream overlay animations working? Thats what I remember you working on last

01:47:01
<transcript>: And seven TV. You Jin's ears with your Twitch emote extensions.

01:47:07
<transcript>: Just got dogs have been on the shoots. Oh, you're good. You're good. Jake.

01:47:19
<transcript>: We did get the stream over the animations. It was it the transitions. Is that what you mean? Like these.

01:47:20
ogjake: Yeah

01:47:25
ogjake: Oh yeah, thats dope

01:47:27
<transcript>: Did it work. I hope it worked. After I said it was work. Yeah, it's working. You can submit them as pull requests.

01:47:27
<transcript>: there's been several

01:47:42
<transcript>: There's been several people on the stream that have created these animations. That one happened to be the one I made, so I don't give credit to it, but watch when we go back, somebody's gonna get credit for it. That was true. You just watched Shrews animation.

01:47:42
<transcript>: it's

01:47:48
ogjake: Very cool

01:47:53
<transcript>: It's open source on GitHub. Feel free to submit a pull request. I will approve it immediately. I won't even look, I'll just approve it basically if you put submit anything to my overlays it's an instant approve.

01:47:55
<transcript>: Okay.

01:47:55
<transcript>: so

01:47:57
<transcript>: So let's actually.

01:47:57
<transcript>: fix this stuff

01:48:02
<transcript>: Fix this stuff. So we got the button. Now we have state error and success still doesn't work.

01:48:08
parcodek: announcements dont work on mobile though

01:48:12
<transcript>: But let's see, it doesn't work because I think state is never undefined. Right. Well, I'm not passing it in that's part of the problem.

01:48:12
<transcript>: let's

01:48:12
nate_codes: That’s legit!

01:48:13
parcodek: they cant see the messages

01:48:15
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:48:19
<transcript>: Chosen.

01:48:21
<transcript>: And then green.

01:48:27
<transcript>: And then incorrect. What do we want these actually to be? I actually just want a state.

01:48:27
<transcript>: equal

01:48:28
<transcript>: Equal.

01:48:28
<transcript>: if

01:48:31
<transcript>: If result answer.

01:48:31
<transcript>: oh the reason

01:48:36
<transcript>: Oh, the reason it could be null is that result could be null or undefined.

01:48:47
<transcript>: So like right now there's no chosen answer. It should be undefined right now. Nothing should be styled because we haven't done anything yet. Right.

01:48:50
<transcript>: So result that answer.

01:48:50
<transcript>: does not

01:48:52
<transcript>: Does not equal or does equal.

01:48:52
<transcript>: the

01:49:03
<transcript>: The current choice name. That's the button. The choice the name. Right. So that's sorry state. If it's that the state is.

01:49:03
<transcript>: success

01:49:04
<transcript>: Success.

01:49:04
<transcript>: if

01:49:06
<transcript>: If it's not.

01:49:14
<transcript>: Okay. There could be a case where it's undefined. We need to handle that.

01:49:17
<transcript>: So let's actually do that first.

01:49:17
<transcript>: right

01:49:19
<transcript>: Right.

01:49:23
<transcript>: Have to learn them now.

01:49:23
<transcript>: i have to actually learn

01:49:25
<transcript>: I have to actually learn it.

01:49:28
<transcript>: Start using the right now.

01:49:33
<transcript>: So let's say if not if result.

01:49:33
<transcript>: is

01:49:35
<transcript>: Is undefined.

01:49:35
<transcript>: then

01:49:38
<transcript>: Then we're gonna say, undefined.

01:49:40
<transcript>: Else.

01:49:41
<transcript>: Right.

01:49:49
<transcript>: We do okay.

01:49:49
<transcript>: else

01:49:51
<transcript>: Else.

01:49:54
<transcript>: Not success. Else.

01:49:55
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:49:59
<transcript>: Oh, this repeat thing.

01:49:59
<transcript>: crazy

01:50:01
nate_codes: WAIT DID SOMEONE SAY VIM?!

01:50:07
<transcript>: Crazy. I'm still doing it. I'm just. Okay. Here we go. Else. Result. That answer. Yeah. Yeah. Then it's success.

01:50:07
<transcript>: elf

01:50:09
beardage: oh speaking of which, prime updated his vim learning game so it works again

01:50:09
<transcript>: Elf it's error.

01:50:15
<transcript>: This Zim change it's gonna get me.

01:50:17
beardage: it's great for learning

01:50:17
<transcript>: Gonna get me.

01:50:23
<transcript>: So that's gonna be State, and that's gonna be.

01:50:23
<transcript>: state

01:50:26
<transcript>: State that's gone away.

01:50:28
beardage: vimbegood

01:50:30
<transcript>: This will be state equals error.

01:50:30
<transcript>: i guess i could

01:50:32
<transcript>: I guess I could put this in the button as well.

01:50:34
<transcript>: This will be.

01:50:34
<transcript>: state

01:50:36
<transcript>: State equals.

01:50:36
<transcript>: success

01:50:37
<transcript>: Success.

01:50:40
<transcript>: Okay. We did some stuff.

01:50:46
<transcript>: Zimbigood it is good. I just. I was getting away with a lot.

01:50:46
<transcript>: in vim

01:50:47
<transcript>: In vim.

01:50:58
<transcript>: I was getting away with a lot because I had a fast repeat. Like when I hit J, it would repeat really fast so I could navigate pretty good just by being lazy.

01:50:58
<transcript>: and

01:51:04
<transcript>: And now not anymore. Announcements don't work on mobile, though they can't see the messages. Oh, that's not good.

01:51:07
<transcript>: Did someone say them.

01:51:07
<transcript>: i did say

01:51:11
<transcript>: I did say them. Nate, we are kneel them. And around here.

01:51:20
<transcript>: Yeah, I need to. I need to check out all primes and stuff. I've watched a couple of his videos for Vim navigation.

01:51:36
<transcript>: I just like watching prime videos. Anyway, that's sounds like I'm talking about Amazon Prime. I like watching prime engine videos anyway, but when they're about them, it's double double dose. I actually want to learn the content. And I just like watching private.

01:51:42
<transcript>: Okay, so we've got some changes. Let's see if they work. New game.

01:51:45
<transcript>: Here it is. What is that? It's a robot.

01:51:45
<transcript>: inspector

01:51:47
<transcript>: Inspector.

01:51:47
<transcript>: looks

01:51:55
<transcript>: Looks like a robot, doesn't it? Oh, this. Okay. So we did something. It's not exactly right. Let's make the delay longer.

01:51:59
daneoshiga: vimcasts are also good, old gems

01:52:00
<transcript>: Let's change that to be.

01:52:08
<transcript>: Let's change that to be five. 5 seconds. Just give me a little more time.

01:52:13
<transcript>: Okay. Iot button. What is this one.

01:52:13
<transcript>: that's maybe

01:52:16
<transcript>: That's maybe IoT button? I don't know.

01:52:16
<transcript>: no

01:52:16
nate_codes: My #1 Rec is always to learn ci” / cip / cit

01:52:18
<transcript>: No, I'm bad at this.

01:52:18
<transcript>: data pip

01:52:23
<transcript>: Data pipeline. So the check Mark's not showing up or the TADA emojis not showing up.

01:52:23
<transcript>: what else

01:52:25
<transcript>: What else is not happening.

01:52:30
<transcript>: I'm struggling with dumb stuff here like I'm taking forever just to get some stylizing stuff done.

01:52:50
<transcript>: My number one Rec is always to learn CI. Quote, CIP, CIT. Yes. Agreed. That part. I got down pretty quick. So I got pretty quick with, like, oh, I want to change this word, like, See, IW I got down that stuff. It's the vertical. It's a simple stuff. The.

01:52:50
<transcript>: vertical

01:52:52
<transcript>: Vertical and horizontal navigation.

01:53:02
<transcript>: I just was so lazy. I just J and came my way around. And now that I've got the slow repeat, it punishes me. So I have to do this. Have to do it.

01:53:09
<transcript>: Vimcaster. Also. Good old gyms. Okay, I'll check those out. Thank you, Danielle.

01:53:09
nate_codes: I went hard on vim configuration like 7-8 years ago...then been using VS Code for the last 1-2 years because I couldn't be bothered to update all of my dot files (and I'm coding less in this position)

01:53:18
<transcript>: Okay. So like, we guess something here. We got a few problems, no success thing. And then these shouldn't show error.

01:53:18
<transcript>: they shouldn't

01:53:21
<transcript>: They shouldn't show error. Unless.

01:53:26
dendenguy: What's slow repeat?

01:53:30
nate_codes: @daneoshiga good ol' Drew neil

01:53:31
<transcript>: They were the one you clicked on, right. So we don't want to set tools and SDKs we don't want to show error States unless you click on the wrong ones. So that's part of the problem.

01:53:34
<transcript>: State error. Okay. Let's see.

01:53:36
nate_codes: He's got excellent content

01:53:37
<transcript>: Not chosen.

01:53:46
<transcript>: The result answer does not equal choice. What does that mean.

01:53:47
beardotdev: hey adam

01:53:51
<transcript>: Result answer so the correct answer does not equal.

01:53:54
<transcript>: Choice? What is choice.

01:53:57
<transcript>: What is choice.

01:53:59
<transcript>: The round choice.

01:54:01
<transcript>: Okay.

01:54:05
<transcript>: The round choice. I gotta think about this.

01:54:05
<transcript>: is that

01:54:09
<transcript>: Is that the thing you clicked on? Yeah, that's the thing you clicked on, right.

01:54:14
<transcript>: Okay.

01:54:14
<transcript>: true

01:54:18
<transcript>: True chosen is true for all of them.

01:54:18
<transcript>: so that

01:54:20
<transcript>: So that's not right.

01:54:21
nate_codes: Hey it's Beard OT Dev! t3ggWave

01:54:22
<transcript>: Let's do.

01:54:22
<transcript>: choice

01:54:23
<transcript>: Choice.

01:54:27
<transcript>: Pools and SDKs. That's what I clicked on.

01:54:27
<transcript>: and the result

01:54:31
rocky_taken: what software do you use?

01:54:32
<transcript>: And the result that answer. Oh, because that was the previous, because I got that one right.

01:54:39
<transcript>: This is not what I want? Chosen to be chosen should be.

01:54:39
<transcript>: that's like

01:54:43
<transcript>: That's like correct. No. What I want is chosen would be.

01:54:50
<transcript>: The choice is equal to this button.

01:54:50
<transcript>: so like

01:54:51
<transcript>: So like.

01:54:53
<transcript>: See.

01:54:56
<transcript>: Name.

01:54:56
<transcript>: oh thank

01:55:05
<transcript>: Oh, thank you so much for the subscription. Six months. Nate. Geez, the pressure's on to keep streaming for six months. Just kidding. I'm definitely gonna keep streaming.

01:55:09
<transcript>: Drew. Knee, Neal.

01:55:09
<transcript>: what

01:55:09
nate_codes: That's the goal! ;)

01:55:24
<transcript>: What slow repeat didn't. So my keyboard settings on my Mac you can, like, change the repeat speed. So, like when you hold down a key, how quickly does it keep repeating the key? And I had it set all the way to the fastest so I could, like, kind of navigate pretty quick.

01:55:31
<transcript>: I just hold them down, J and now it's I slowed it down so that it reminds me that's not the best way.

01:55:42
<transcript>: Nate, you went hard on Vim Configures for seven, eight years and been using Vs code for the last one here's. Gonna be about it. Update on my dot files. Yeah, yeah, no, I get it. What is your position now, Nate.

01:55:48
<transcript>: Hey, Bear, dot.

01:55:48
<transcript>: it

01:55:48
nate_codes: Just savin w/ Subtember! Everybody remember, you got 10 more days of 30% off! Save money!

01:55:50
<transcript>: It's beard, OT Dev.

01:55:54
nate_codes: I'm a lead software architect

01:56:00
<transcript>: Oh, it's beard. O T. It's not Bear dot. Oh, Geez, I say Bear Dev. Wait, it is Bear Dev. You're just messing. Nate's. Just messing. Welcome to Chat, Rocky.

01:56:00
<transcript>: what slopper

01:56:07
<transcript>: What Slopper do you use? Do you mean my editor? My editor is neovem. I moved from vs code like a month ago.

01:56:07
<transcript>: on stream here

01:56:16
nate_codes: @adamdotdev LUL you haven't realized how much of a troll I am...

01:56:21
<transcript>: On stream here. Basically, I did it because Twitch was really good about Twitch. Chat was really good about teaching me, Neil them, so I didn't have to, like, learn it the hard way. Everyone in Twisted Out would just yell at me when I do stupid stuff. Like, no, no, hit this like, Yes.

01:56:24
<transcript>: Lead Software architect.

01:56:26
dendenguy: Ah that makes sense, what's the better way?

01:56:30
madlep: similar story. Vim -> VS Code -> Neovim. vimscript was pain, but using lua in neovim makes a big difference in approaching it

01:56:32
<transcript>: At restaurant you are I think I have I just I'm naive. And I just always assume I like, assume when people say things.

01:56:32
<transcript>: that it's just

01:56:35
<transcript>: That it's just I don't know the simplest definition of what the said.

01:56:40
<transcript>: I don't know. Maybe that's a Midwestern United States thing or something.

01:56:44
<transcript>: Saven was September. Yeah, I've actually done that a ton.

01:56:44
<transcript>: i've like

01:56:49
dypox: How do you display the function signature on the first line when you have a large function to scroll through?

01:56:51
<transcript>: I've like subscribed to lots of people for six months because 30% off. Why not? I'm gonna be here watching them for six months.

01:56:58
<transcript>: What's the better way? So page up and page down.

01:56:58
<transcript>: for vertical

01:56:58
nate_codes: I don't speak in simple terms, I speak only in rhymes and riddles...

01:57:00
<transcript>: For Vertical navigation.

01:57:00
<transcript>: i'm just

01:57:05
beardage: I also learned vim by streaming, chat was so helpful

01:57:07
<transcript>: I'm just. I'm still so bad at remembering to do it for horizontal navigation. It would be like.

01:57:07
<transcript>: f and t

01:57:09
<transcript>: F, and T.

01:57:09
<transcript>: so

01:57:16
<transcript>: So F goes back or capital F goes back and then you can like semicolon through the characters.

01:57:26
<transcript>: I'll go forward to like that in. I can do C in, and then I have to do it. That's the problem. You end up having to like, still tab.

01:57:26
<transcript>: so many times

01:57:27
2dorkstv: I was encouraged to keep going with neovim because of twitch. Learned a ton just watching people work

01:57:28
<transcript>: So many times I don't know.

01:57:28
<transcript>: i just do

01:57:34
<transcript>: I just do okay. Choice should be I'm trying to log short.

01:57:38
<transcript>: Cname doesn't equal choice. Let's see if this works.

01:57:43
<transcript>: Express link. What is this thing? Launch Wizard.

01:57:43
<transcript>: now

01:57:45
<transcript>: Now workspaces web.

01:57:52
<transcript>: So we're logging choice. It doesn't. That's not helpful.

01:57:52
<transcript>: did it work

01:57:54
<transcript>: Did it work? Did we fix it.

01:58:01
<transcript>: What is this work box? I don't know. Iot one click. I'm so bad at this game.

01:58:04
<transcript>: I don't think it worked.

01:58:04
<transcript>: oh choice

01:58:07
<transcript>: Oh, choice. I want to log chosen.

01:58:12
<transcript>: What am I getting here with these errors.

01:58:12
<transcript>: two children

01:58:17
<transcript>: Two children with the same key oh code build twice.

01:58:18
nate_codes: I/A are pretty great for horizontal nav (enter insert mode at begginning/end of line). I used A for years without realizing I existed

01:58:20
<transcript>: That's not good.

01:58:20
<transcript>: i thought i'd fix

01:58:22
<transcript>: I thought I'd fix that on the search.

01:58:22
<transcript>: so

01:58:26
<transcript>: So they're all true right now that's not good. So they're both undefined.

01:58:26
<transcript>: so

01:58:29
<transcript>: So it needs to be like.

01:58:29
<transcript>: a choice

01:58:32
<transcript>: A choice does not equal undefined.

01:58:32
<transcript>: or choice

01:58:34
<transcript>: Or choice and.

01:58:42
<transcript>: Maybe. Okay. So those are undefined. That's good. What is this one? Cost Explorer.

01:58:44
<transcript>: Okay. So that works.

01:58:44
<transcript>: we got

01:58:46
<transcript>: We got the.

01:58:46
<transcript>: little

01:58:47
<transcript>: Little thing on it.

01:58:59
<transcript>: What is this one? I. O. T. A. Workspaces web code. Commit launch wizard. Geez, I don't know. Launch wizard. Yeah, okay, so those should not be styled when they weren't chosen.

01:59:02
<transcript>: So what is wrong here.

01:59:02
<transcript>: it's got

01:59:05
<transcript>: It's got three true.

01:59:05
<transcript>: oh chuck

01:59:09
<transcript>: Oh, Chuck, should not be not equal. I'm so bad at this.

01:59:12
<transcript>: That should be equals right.

01:59:12
madlep: @DypoX If it's same plugin I'm using, nvim-treesitter-context

01:59:32
<transcript>: Away from adlebm or vim to vs. Code neovem Vincecript was pain, but using lieu any of them makes a difference in approaching it. How do you display the function signature on the first line when you have a large function to scroll through? Oh, that's a that's a Neoven plugin. Does anyone remember? I don't remember what's called now context. I think NVM context.

01:59:37
<transcript>: You speak only Ryzen Riddles. Nate, I'll have to remember that.

01:59:43
<transcript>: Yeah. Chad is so helpful, learning basically everything. So did I know beardage, that you were a streamer.

01:59:43
<transcript>: want to follow

01:59:45
<transcript>: Want to follow these. I can catch one of your streams.

01:59:47
nate_codes: https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-context

01:59:56
wesleycoder: hello, first time here

02:00:00
<transcript>: Encourage to keep going with the oven because of Twitch learn ton just watching people work. It's so true. I love it's such a hobby. Like could I have maybe saved a ton of time and just done the Vin binding thing in vs. Code. Yes.

02:00:00
<transcript>: would i have gotten

02:00:05
<transcript>: Would I have gotten, like 99% of the benefit? Yes. Probably. I don't know.

02:00:05
<transcript>: but

02:00:09
dypox: Ty, love u @madlep @nate_codes

02:00:11
<transcript>: But it's such a fun thing to play with. My new of them configuration became like my new favorite hobby. And that's why I did.

02:00:17
wesleycoder: do you deploy t3 stack to aws?

02:00:18
beardage: I haven't in a long time but I might get back into it, I have a fun side project atm

02:00:19
<transcript>: Yeah, Capital I N. A. That's a good call at night.

02:00:30
iamreda: you using webpack ?

02:00:32
<transcript>: Inventory. Sitter. Context. That's it. That's the one madlip. Thank you and Nate, welcome to Chat. Wesley coder. First time. Here. Welcome.

02:00:37
michalvankodev: Do you use nvim v8 or v7?

02:00:39
<transcript>: Do you deploy T three stack to AWS? So, Wesley, I'm gonna be deploying this one to Versaille.

02:00:42
<transcript>: There are some things.

02:00:49
<transcript>: Tm in the works for deploying Next JS apps into your A BIS account.

02:00:54
nate_codes: Man y'all have it easy..when I was learning vim I had nothing but Tim Pope's github and Thoughtbot dotfiles and ~50 hrs of weekend time in a mont h

02:00:55
<transcript>: I built a thing called Nest, which is a CLI tool that did it, but it's based on this open source framework.

02:00:55
<transcript>: that's not

02:00:56
<transcript>: That's not.

02:00:56
<transcript>: very

02:00:59
<transcript>: Very actively maintained anymore.

02:01:03
<transcript>: There is a maintainer that was doing a tough.

02:01:03
<transcript>: on this thing

02:01:07
<transcript>: On this thing trying to maintain the pace of verselle's team.

02:01:07
<transcript>: building

02:01:16
<transcript>: Building next year. And it's just always like a version behind. So it doesn't have all the like it doesn't have middle way and a bunch of the version twelve features next. But.

02:01:16
<transcript>: there's something coming

02:01:17
wesleycoder: have you tried terraform for this?

02:01:20
s1hofmann: I'm programming for fun besides my day job. After watching your stream for a while I started to dig into neovim and tmux again. It actually works better than VSCode for me when building native node addons

02:01:26
<transcript>: There's something coming, and I'm not gonna say anymore because I can't. But there's other things coming to make it easier to deploy an XJS app with full Versaille functionality on your A Tobis account.

02:01:32
<transcript>: I am Rita. Welcome to Chat. I am everyone's using Webpack, just inadvertently.

02:01:32
<transcript>: or indirectly

02:01:33
wesleycoder: I'm eager to hear more about this

02:01:34
<transcript>: Or indirectly.

02:01:42
<transcript>: Inadvertently works too. We're all using webpack, but it's usually abstracted away from you. I would not recommend learning webpack in 2022.

02:01:42
<transcript>: sounds

02:01:44
<transcript>: Sounds awful.

02:01:44
<transcript>: mostly

02:01:53
<transcript>: Mostly just use the things that abstract webpack away or I guess if you use Veet, is it not? Is it a replacement for Web pack? I think it's a replacement for Web pack.

02:01:53
<transcript>: but just

02:02:00
<transcript>: But just like don't use webpack directly. I use Next JS, which abstracts away all the webpack stuff.

02:02:04
nate_codes: Learning CDKTF for work right now...seems pretty interesting but I'm still hoping they let me use Pulumi or SST for microservice orchestration

02:02:06
<transcript>: Some people use Create, React app or I don't know. There's a bunch of other things that do the same.

02:02:08
wesleycoder: I'm migrating my projects from wp to vite

02:02:15
beardage: yeah use vite and vitest

02:02:24
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat Michael VANC Odev Venkodiv do use invent version eight or version seven. I'm using zero eight. I'm on the bleeding edge. I'm using, like the latest commit as of a couple days ago because I can't. I can't wait. I need all the new stuff. Give me all the new.

02:02:24
<transcript>: naked code

02:02:28
<transcript>: Naked codes. You'll have it easy. When I was learning them. I know nothing but Tim. Pope's, GitHub.

02:02:31
<transcript>: Oh, man.

02:02:31
<transcript>: that sounds

02:02:34
<transcript>: That sounds painful. I mean, it's a fun hobby, but that sounds painful.

02:02:42
<transcript>: Wesley Codr if I tried TerraForm for this for this game, specifically, I'm guessing this one's. Cloud Nine, by the way, what do you guys think? Cloud nine.

02:02:44
<transcript>: Maybe.

02:02:50
<transcript>: Clad nine. Yeah. Oh, now I didn't get the little.

02:02:56
<transcript>: Chosen his choice, and see that name is equal to choice.

02:02:56
<transcript>: i'm getting

02:02:59
<transcript>: I'm getting something wrong here.

02:03:01
<transcript>: I've not thought about TerraForm for this.

02:03:01
<transcript>: what would

02:03:04
wesleycoder: this meaning t3 on aws

02:03:06
madlep: nvim 0.8 nightly is fine. Occasionally have plugins break due to deprecations if they're using private functions and things.

02:03:08
<transcript>: What would I maybe elaborate? Wesley, what would I use TerraForm for for this particular project? I don't really use TerraForm.

02:03:08
<transcript>: generally

02:03:10
<transcript>: Generally speaking.

02:03:14
<transcript>: I use like for Infrastructure's code. I generally use.

02:03:20
<transcript>: The CDK I'm trying to use SSD and Arc codes more architect.

02:03:20
<transcript>: i

02:03:20
iamreda: what's wrong w/ webpack ?

02:03:22
<transcript>: I think they're nice.

02:03:22
<transcript>: layers

02:03:25
<transcript>: Layers on top of layers of abstraction.

02:03:25
<transcript>: tier four

02:03:37
ohmymndy: Everytime I hear Cloud9 it reminds me of that tv series Superstore, it was proper fun

02:03:42
<transcript>: Tier four. I don't use much. I'm just never learned the DSL and at this stage I don't feel like I need to. I don't do work for clients at ease there for anything like that. I mostly work with small startups and I hope to not work with anyone anymore. That's a whole nother story, but small start of the June really don't use TerraForm.

02:03:42
<transcript>: i'm programming

02:03:54
<transcript>: I'm programming for fun. Besides my day job. After watching your stream for a while, I started digging to Neil, Vim and Timxyn awesome, so it works better than the Vs code for me when building native know that on okay, very cool. Native known addons.

02:04:15
<transcript>: Learning CDK TF for work right now seems pretty interesting. I'm still hoping they let me use Palumi or SSE or Microservice Orchestration. Yeah, I really want to be like an SST guy. I just got to get into it. The problem. The reason I always use the CDK is I write a lot of app sync APIs, and I specifically write VTL templates.

02:04:35
<transcript>: And none of the other like Architect SSD, all these really nice serverless abstractions. On top of all this Infrastructure's code, they don't really cater to that use case CDK. It least has like hot reloading. So if I make a change to VTL template and save it, I can hot flop it just through direct SDK calls. That's nice. I do a lot of.

02:04:43
<transcript>: Vtl work. Not a lot of people do, so it's just not a thing that SSDs ever gonna focus on, and I get it.

02:04:47
<transcript>: Migrated from webpack to Veet.

02:04:47
<transcript>: use

02:04:53
<transcript>: Use Vtest. I don't know if I'm saying that right. I never know if I'm saying anything right.

02:04:56
<transcript>: This meaning P three on AWS.

02:04:57
laytanl_: vtl is gross

02:05:11
<transcript>: This project we're working around right now is T three, and I'm gonna deploy it for sale. I don't know. I'm behind on chat a little bit. So.

02:05:12
nate_codes: @OhMyMndy such a good show!

02:05:12
wesleycoder: I'm trying to get terraform for next on aws but it seems to be a lot of overhead, but I have little choice since I'm a frontend engineer and the choice of terraform comes from backend and devops team

02:05:28
<transcript>: In Vim Zero Eight nightly is fine. Occasionally have plugins break due to deprecations. If you're using private functions things. Yeah. Okay. Well, I feel better that you said that madlift. I don't feel quite so. Like I'm living on the edge. What's wrong with Rich webpack? It's not that there's anything wrong with webpack. It's that learning to like, configure web pack.

02:05:30
<transcript>: Is a waste of time.

02:05:46
nate_codes: @wesleycoder if you're using AWS check out CDKTF....may be a bit easier for you to use and backend teams should be OK w/ it since it's TF based

02:05:51
<transcript>: It's extremely hard. For one thing. If you've ever looked at webpack configuration, it's just a lot. It's just a lot to learn. And I just wouldn't recommend investing time in learning that stuff because I think the future is never having to think about it. Like as a developer building applications, you shouldn't have to think about Webpack. It should be abstracted away by some meta framework or.

02:05:51
<transcript>: something

02:05:58
nate_codes: *should*....no guarantees XD

02:06:10
<transcript>: Something easier to work with than web pack. So I would never recommend somebody invest their time learning how to configure Web Pack unless you're building one of those abstractions. There are people who know they need to learn how to configure web pack, and they can safely ignore me. But if you're like, not sure. Should I learn Web Pack or not? Don't. Just don't.

02:06:10
<transcript>: use something

02:06:16
<transcript>: Use something that gets rid of it. Vtaill is gross. That's right. Latent is I know it's Chris, and I still use it.

02:06:16
<transcript>: i so

02:06:22
<transcript>: I so fast and there's no runtime dependencies, no code rot, no cold starts. It's just.

02:06:35
<transcript>: It's optimal from, like a runtime standpoint. And I always choose that. I don't know why I put myself through torture from a DevX perspective. Every time I hear Cloud Nine, it reminds me of that TV series Superstar. It was proper fun. I've never heard of this.

02:06:35
<transcript>: super

02:06:36
<transcript>: Superstore.

02:06:43
wesleycoder: knowing how to configure webpack is a huge skill but the gains are becoming smaller over time

02:06:45
iamreda: aight, going straight to vite

02:06:48
<transcript>: Trying to get TerraForm for next on AWS, but it seems to be a lot of overhead. I have little choice in some of the choices comes from back in. Yeah, yeah, that's common. I know a lot of bigger companies.

02:06:48
<transcript>: that have

02:06:51
<transcript>: That have DevOps themes use TerraForm.

02:06:51
<transcript>: and

02:06:54
<transcript>: And I can get that that's.

02:06:54
<transcript>: a struggle

02:07:03
<transcript>: A struggle when you don't have a choice, you're using TerraForm. You're trying to deploy. Next on AWS. I don't know the answers for TerraForm, specifically.

02:07:07
nate_codes: @iamreda Astro is also good... >.>

02:07:10
<transcript>: But I doubt there's any solution that deploys all of the next JS features like the latest stuff.

02:07:10
<transcript>: on

02:07:28
<transcript>: On AWS with TerraForm. I don't think there is. If there were, I would assume the project I was leveraging with Nest doesn't exist. Like if there's already something with TerraForm that they would all be sharing the same thing. Maybe they are. Maybe the TerraForm adapters use the same stuff I was using and then you're using like, version Eleven features.

02:07:31
<transcript>: Okay.

02:07:31
<transcript>: using

02:07:33
nate_codes: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs

02:07:34
wesleycoder: thanks for your insights

02:07:42
<transcript>: Using a bit of check out so you could have maybe the easier should no guarantees knowing how to figure what pack is a huge skill, but the gains are becoming smaller over time. Yes.

02:07:48
<transcript>: Going straight to Veet Astro is also good Astrue is also good.

02:07:50
<transcript>: Okay.

02:07:55
<transcript>: Yeah. No worries, Wesley. Thanks for the follow. I appreciate it.

02:08:00
<transcript>: Okay. So let's let's figure out this stupid button styling thing.

02:08:00
<transcript>: i spend half my

02:08:03
<transcript>: I spend half my time streaming the styling buttons.

02:08:09
<transcript>: Maybe a Lara Bar will help.

02:08:13
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow and more Dev.

02:08:15
<transcript>: And more.

02:08:18
iamreda: @nate_codes yeah ikn, just still wondering which one to choose for a side project

02:08:35
<transcript>: Chosen.

02:08:42
<transcript>: Chosen is false for all of them. Which choose what.

02:08:45
<transcript>: That one's gonna be repost, right.

02:08:49
<transcript>: It is okay. So I false for two.

02:08:49
<transcript>: okay three

02:08:50
ohmymndy: The tech choices in the JS/TS world are paralyzing me...

02:08:53
<transcript>: Okay, three of them are false. One of mystery. That's the way I expected it to look.

02:09:08
ohmymndy: t3 stack seems really nice though, definitely have to learn that

02:09:13
<transcript>: Something very hard in my Lara Bar. Probably a date pit. And Madam broke my teeth.

02:09:17
nate_codes: @iamreda same XD. I've done evaluations on Serverless Framework, Pulumi, and SST for work...haven't gotten approval in months (prod ops team is constantly overloaded)...now debating what to use for side projects since idk wtf will overlap with work FeelsBadMan

02:09:17
<transcript>: What is this thing? Box. Stoke.

02:09:20
<transcript>: What.

02:09:20
madlep: @OhMyMndy This is why I stick to backend dev MaxLOL

02:09:22
<transcript>: Polly.

02:09:26
ohmymndy: Everytime I come back to "But Laravel could do all of that, and I like it a lot"

02:09:29
<transcript>: Okay. So success and error. That's correct. Only one of my susites? Yeah, Yeah.

02:09:33
<transcript>: Thanks so much for following Alex.

02:09:37
<transcript>: Now T three SEC is really nice.

02:09:43
<transcript>: Tech choices and JSTs world paralyzing me yeah, I think that's what I'm gonna start my.

02:09:43
<transcript>: my

02:09:46
<transcript>: My education career my career my career is a trainer.

02:09:46
<transcript>: i think

02:09:47
ohmymndy: @madlep True, but I also mean TS for backend stuff...

02:09:49
<transcript>: I think I'm trying to start with like.

02:09:49
<transcript>: helping people

02:09:53
nate_codes: @OhMyMndy Laravel is a good framework, don't be ashamed to use PHP, modern PHP is much better than the PHP Tech Twitter makes fun of all the time

02:09:57
<transcript>: Helping people make the right trade offs and choose the right technology for the problem that they have, because I know that's a very hard thing when you come into this industry.

02:09:57
<transcript>: you've got

02:10:06
<transcript>: You've got a few years of experience, and you need to make a decision about which technology to use. It's just overwhelming. There's so many options.

02:10:06
<transcript>: and just helping

02:10:10
<transcript>: And just helping to kind of think through that. I don't know if it'll be a series of stuff. I don't know.

02:10:26
<transcript>: I'm gonna do like a whole Infrastructure's code series too, just to review all there's, like a dozen options at this point.

02:10:26
<transcript>: and to kind of talk about

02:10:28
<transcript>: And to kind of talk about the pros and cons of each.

02:10:34
<transcript>: But if it's side project Nate.

02:10:34
<transcript>: there's really

02:10:37
nate_codes: t3 is likely best starting point for full stack TS based app currently...Vite/Astro are better if you don't have all the needs of full stack

02:10:38
<transcript>: There's really only a couple I would choose for side projects, I guess.

02:10:38
<transcript>: i mean

02:10:42
<transcript>: I mean, if you've got a lot of experience with service, Raymarker bloomy.

02:10:42
<transcript>: then

02:10:49
<transcript>: Then I guess whatever you have the most experience with would be great for side projects. I do love Architect and SST for their minimalness.

02:10:50
ohmymndy: Exactly! I really like the new PHP to be honest, the c like old school functions are still a mess, but I use the Laravel Facades and helpers for arrays/collections/string manipulation anyway

02:10:52
iamreda: @OhMyMndy I tried Laravel once, I really didnt like it

02:10:54
<transcript>: So I stick to back endow? Yeah.

02:11:04
<transcript>: Okay, I can't keep up now. You guys type too much.

02:11:04
<transcript>: i'm just gonna move on

02:11:06
<transcript>: I'm just gonna move on.

02:11:07
nate_codes: @adamdotdev that's the thought...if I'm gonna learn somethign for work I'll use it for side projects even if it's not quite as simple/perfect

02:11:12
s1hofmann: Alright, kid woke up, have to jump. Until next time!

02:11:12
<transcript>: States of State and chosen are correct. Now we're just not doing the right thing somewhere.

02:11:12
<transcript>: i guess

02:11:14
<transcript>: I guess I need.

02:11:14
<transcript>: to

02:11:16
<transcript>: To succeed.

02:11:16
<transcript>: need

02:11:20
<transcript>: Need to also pass in chosen don't I.

02:11:23
<transcript>: Need to pass in here.

02:11:23
<transcript>: chose

02:11:24
ohmymndy: @iamreda Curious to know why? Was it because you were used to Symfony?

02:11:25
<transcript>: Chosen boolean.

02:11:28
<transcript>: I guess.

02:11:33
<transcript>: And then here.

02:11:39
<transcript>: I can make better choices so stay tuned. Error.

02:11:41
<transcript>: And.

02:11:44
<transcript>: So and.

02:11:44
<transcript>: chosen

02:11:45
<transcript>: Chosen.

02:11:49
<transcript>: Only want to show it in that case. Right.

02:11:53
<transcript>: I think.

02:11:53
<transcript>: but then we need

02:11:56
<transcript>: But then we need to also appear.

02:12:00
<transcript>: Undefined or.

02:12:01
<transcript>: Getting ugly.

02:12:01
<transcript>: it needs to

02:12:05
<transcript>: It needs to be that or if not chosen.

02:12:08
<transcript>: No.

02:12:08
<transcript>: no because

02:12:11
<transcript>: No, because of the success. Oh, this is so ugly.

02:12:16
<transcript>: When I do this, because now we're gonna have unstyled buttons, right.

02:12:25
<transcript>: Like if I click on what is this? Is that Fargate.

02:12:25
<transcript>: it is

02:12:25
wesleycoder: I'm using t3 on a BFF service (backend for frontend, layer of service abstraction). it plays nicer than graphql and brings more control to the frontend team

02:12:29
iamreda: @OhMyMndy I'm not really used to any php framework, I was just coming from a js side

02:12:32
<transcript>: It is. Yes. You have their unstyled. This is so bad. So many bad things. I need to just hire somebody to build my front ends.

02:12:32
<transcript>: i'm not

02:12:35
<transcript>: I'm not a front end guy suffer tuning.

02:12:48
ohmymndy: Gotta hop in a meeting, see you all in a bit!

02:12:49
<transcript>: See Hoffman Until Next time. Thanks for joining me.

02:12:58
<transcript>: See you in a bit. Mandy.

02:13:02
<transcript>: All right.

02:13:07
<transcript>: I guess I didn't pass chosen in for one thing.

02:13:07
<transcript>: that'll

02:13:09
<transcript>: That'll help a little bit.

02:13:15
<transcript>: That is definitely.

02:13:15
<transcript>: ses

02:13:17
<transcript>: Ses.

02:13:19
<transcript>: Okay.

02:13:31
<transcript>: So.

02:13:31
<transcript>: chosen

02:13:33
<transcript>: Chosen can be.

02:13:36
<transcript>: Undefined. What's wrong with that.

02:13:44
<transcript>: Boolean or unfinished enzymble type boolean or undefined what.

02:13:46
<transcript>: Oh.

02:13:46
<transcript>: or

02:13:48
<transcript>: Or empty strings.

02:13:48
<transcript>: can chosen

02:13:48
iamreda: are you using an api request to get those aws services ?

02:13:50
<transcript>: Can chosen to be an empty string.

02:13:59
<transcript>: Really.

02:13:59
<transcript>: how would it be

02:14:03
<transcript>: How would it be an empty string? So a choice is a string run to file.

02:14:08
<transcript>: Well, I guess we do this.

02:14:13
<transcript>: Now it's just boolean, right? Yeah.

02:14:15
<transcript>: Okay.

02:14:18
<transcript>: So that's a little better.

02:14:26
<transcript>: I hate this. I hate working on buttons. Oh, my word. Someone saved me.

02:14:32
<transcript>: Using API requests to get those adbis services. So we just created.

02:14:32
<transcript>: a map

02:14:34
<transcript>: A map on the server.

02:14:41
<transcript>: Using we downloaded all the icons and we did some, like, local scripting to kind of massage the names and all that.

02:14:49
<transcript>: So we just kind of made a map of all the all the services with their icons and everything.

02:14:59
<transcript>: So we're pretty far off right now we have to highlight problem. We don't have the little.

02:15:04
<transcript>: Tada happening. Oh, it should be. And chosen. I keep doing the opposite.

02:15:11
<transcript>: Why don't I keep doing the opposite of everything I want to do? It started earlier in the stream with filter. I was doing the opposite. Boolean logic.

02:15:18
<transcript>: Keep doing the opposite. Just need to just go against my instincts today. Oh, we know what this one's gonna be.

02:15:18
<transcript>: sync

02:15:21
<transcript>: Sync Box Frost.

02:15:21
<transcript>: okay so

02:15:21
iamreda: so its hard coded

02:15:24
nate_codes: @ohmymndy t3ggWave

02:15:24
wesleycoder: the background of the correct answer could be green too

02:15:26
<transcript>: Okay. So we got the icon, at least. Okay. So now we've got to fix so many things.

02:15:26
<transcript>: so many things

02:15:27
<transcript>: So many things.

02:15:32
<transcript>: Also, why did that just load two of them.

02:15:37
<transcript>: Because it's not stopping me from clicking.

02:15:43
iamreda: @wesleycoder yeah agree

02:15:45
<transcript>: So many bad things.

02:15:53
<transcript>: The background of the correct answer could be Green, too. That's good. Call. Leslie.

02:15:58
<transcript>: Yeah. So it's hard coded, Rita. That's right.

02:16:03
<transcript>: Yeah the background is supposed to be.

02:16:03
<transcript>: what

02:16:05
<transcript>: What is this? In Proton.

02:16:10
<transcript>: It's supposed to be the outline, and then that that's supposed. Oh, yeah, yeah, that's supposed to be green, too.

02:16:12
<transcript>: Everything's broken.

02:16:12
<transcript>: where

02:16:17
<transcript>: Where it was never fixed. I don't know. Border Green Tech Screen nine.

02:16:17
<transcript>: and then

02:16:18
<transcript>: And then.

02:16:20
<transcript>: They're like a page.

02:16:20
<transcript>: right

02:16:27
<transcript>: Right. Equivalent. Like I just want to randomly go. I guess word. Just tap word a bunch.

02:16:27
<transcript>: of

02:16:31
<transcript>: Of here we go. Hover. No, we want after.

02:16:33
<transcript>: Oh.

02:16:40
<transcript>: There no after? Yeah? After background green nine right there. Oh, I bet I have to move the after? Yeah, Yeah.

02:16:43
<transcript>: There's gonna be somewhere here.

02:16:43
<transcript>: after

02:16:45
<transcript>: After here we go.

02:16:47
<transcript>: After.

02:16:47
<transcript>: green

02:16:49
wesleycoder: every dev: fix 1 bug, 4 new bugs added

02:16:50
<transcript>: Green. Here it is. Orange.

02:16:50
<transcript>: so we

02:16:52
<transcript>: So we want to go.

02:16:55
<transcript>: On a yank.

02:16:59
<transcript>: Back to Space? So I'm gonna do yank.

02:16:59
<transcript>: like that

02:17:01
<transcript>: Like that. Yeah.

02:17:01
<transcript>: and i'm gonna

02:17:04
fragaverage: orange-9?

02:17:04
nate_codes: USEFFECT DEPENDENCY LISTS! Whoops sorry what happened? Sorry I was just back in the T3 trenches where am I?

02:17:05
<transcript>: And I'm gonna put that in the up here in this.

02:17:08
fragaverage: is that even valid tailwind?

02:17:15
<transcript>: Okay, so there's our after background Orange, nine.

02:17:22
fragaverage: oh custom colors I guess?

02:17:24
<transcript>: Let's see if I do.

02:17:31
<transcript>: This not having my J's, and.

02:17:41
<transcript>: My slow horizontal and vertical navigation is driving me nuts, but it's necessary. It's necessary. The necessary evil.

02:17:44
<transcript>: All right, I'll show this again.

02:17:47
<transcript>: Looks like a briefcase. What is that.

02:17:51
<transcript>: Data Pipeline Server Migration service.

02:17:51
<transcript>: no

02:18:01
<transcript>: No data pipeline. Okay, so there's the background screen. We did that, right. We got the correct and the incorrect one styled correctly. Just not the other two. Now, right.

02:18:07
<transcript>: What is this? This is something with it's. Got the brains. That Sage maker, eh.

02:18:07
<transcript>: worked

02:18:09
<transcript>: Worked I don't know.

02:18:09
<transcript>: the timer

02:18:12
<transcript>: The timer. Oh, I got it. China's. Okay.

02:18:14
<transcript>: Okay.

02:18:14
<transcript>: so

02:18:18
<transcript>: So those shouldn't be showing if it's not chosen, that's what it is.

02:18:18
<transcript>: it's

02:18:20
<transcript>: It's.

02:18:23
<transcript>: Here.

02:18:23
<transcript>: it should be

02:18:24
<transcript>: It should be.

02:18:28
<transcript>: And not chosen.

02:18:28
nate_codes: dude wtf are all these services

02:18:33
<transcript>: I know that one.

02:18:36
<transcript>: Well, that didn't fix that, did it.

02:18:41
<transcript>: State error.

02:18:41
<transcript>: on

02:18:43
<transcript>: On chosen.

02:18:44
nate_codes: AWS is wild

02:18:46
dendenguy: Got any resources for good/efficient navigation in neovim?

02:18:48
<transcript>: Keep doing the opposite. Keep doing it.

02:18:48
<transcript>: okay

02:18:51
<transcript>: Okay. Now we just got the the border color.

02:18:54
<transcript>: What are all these services? That's right. That's a great question.

02:18:57
<transcript>: They are custom colors for I guess right.

02:19:02
<transcript>: Use affect dependency lists what.

02:19:05
<transcript>: What.

02:19:10
<transcript>: Uses the fact dependencies lists. Are you saying I don't need them.

02:19:14
<transcript>: I don't need my use effect dependency like.

02:19:14
<transcript>: use effect

02:19:16
<transcript>: Use effect in here. Do I.

02:19:16
<transcript>: if you weren't seeing

02:19:20
<transcript>: If you weren't seeing that on my stream, what were you? What were we seeing.

02:19:24
<transcript>: There are feature change something just happened. What has happened.

02:19:27
nate_codes: Nah just when I see double event / nonevent firings that's basically always the root cause lol

02:19:33
<transcript>: Good if it navigation new of him. Yeah, promagen. Just watch primitive stuff. That's what I'm gonna watch.

02:19:38
<transcript>: Oh? When you see? Yeah? All right? Strict mode.

02:19:43
<transcript>: Okay.

02:19:43
<transcript>: so

02:19:47
<transcript>: So I don't like how I'm gonna fix this, but I'm gonna fix it.

02:19:49
<transcript>: State.

02:19:52
<transcript>: Equals undefined, or.

02:19:58
<transcript>: Oh, this is gonna be so ugly or state equals error.

02:19:58
<transcript>: and

02:20:00
<transcript>: And.

02:20:02
wesleycoder: I'm on a hype to use xstate and every time I see this kind of button State logic I start to think on the ways a state machine would solve the problem

02:20:04
<transcript>: Not chosen.

02:20:04
beardage: @Dendenguy also check out ThePrimeagen/VimBeGood on github

02:20:06
<transcript>: Is that what I'm looking for.

02:20:08
<transcript>: So ugly.

02:20:17
<transcript>: I hate it.

02:20:25
<transcript>: I'm gonna hate to use X state every time I see this kind of button state logic.

02:20:29
<transcript>: Yeah. This might be a case where.

02:20:29
<transcript>: something

02:20:35
<transcript>: Something better than what I'm doing, like use, reducer or a state machine or something would be better.

02:20:39
dendenguy: Cheers

02:20:48
<transcript>: Also Dindon Guy, just hang out here in chat and or start streaming. Just start streaming. You'll learn new of him so fast.

02:20:51
<transcript>: Because everyone will help you.

02:20:54
<transcript>: What is this thing? This is Lex.

02:21:01
<transcript>: Okay. Now we just got the focus problem or the highlighter whatever that is the Hover problem.

02:21:04
<transcript>: Is that a problem? Just on mobile.

02:21:07
<transcript>: Oh, that looks ugly.

02:21:12
<transcript>: Yeah, it's only on mobile, so we got to fix that.

02:21:16
<transcript>: Cli.

02:21:16
<transcript>: look

02:21:18
<transcript>: Look at this playing our game.

02:21:21
<transcript>: The styling is awful on nonmobile.

02:21:22
dendenguy: Yea I'm learning a bunch from ypur stream

02:21:25
<transcript>: That is Kubernetesum EKS Cloud. Yeah.

02:21:33
beardage: dude I want to use xstate at work so bad, people keep telling me it's not worth it but the state machine visualization integration with storybook is worth it imo

02:21:33
<transcript>: Just keep hanging out Dindon or start streaming yourself and you will you'll learn all the things.

02:21:34
<transcript>: what is this

02:21:35
<transcript>: What is this.

02:21:37
<transcript>: Game kit.

02:21:37
<transcript>: our sumeri

02:21:46
<transcript>: Our Sumerian that's like a 3D thing looking at I might for in a row, we're gonna have to have streaks. We got so much to build? I gotta stop messing around with stupid front end stuff.

02:21:57
<transcript>: Did you know Amazon had a quantum legend? Did you know there's, like, quantum computing stuff you can do on AWS, it's kind of nuts.

02:22:00
<transcript>: I'm at like 600 or something.

02:22:00
<transcript>: we're

02:22:03
<transcript>: We're just gonna keep going till I get one wrong.

02:22:03
<transcript>: i did

02:22:07
<transcript>: I did have some Lions made this morning. It's supposed to help with thinking.

02:22:12
<transcript>: Oh, I might be stumped here.

02:22:17
parcodek: I left for 10 minutes and came back to amazons quantum computers

02:22:18
<transcript>: Work. Docs is my guess, but I feel like that could be wrong. Carretto is like the Java runtime.

02:22:18
<transcript>: it's on

02:22:20
<transcript>: It's on Game kit.

02:22:20
<transcript>: not app config

02:22:23
<transcript>: Not app config work, Docs. Ooh. Got it. Nailed it.

02:22:26
<transcript>: First try.

02:22:34
<transcript>: Left for ten minutes and came back to Amazon's. Quantum Computers. That's right, Parcode. We're talking about Quantum Computing. What is this one.

02:22:34
<transcript>: it's not

02:22:41
<transcript>: It's not I am not cloud Watch, not Aurora. It's batch. I guess process of elimination.

02:22:46
<transcript>: Is that eight in a row? I really should be keeping track. It's gonna be RDS.

02:22:54
nate_codes: Dude what is your stream schedule? Do you stream literally nocturnal EST hours?

02:22:57
<transcript>: I can went to play you all in this game multiplayer style. What is this.

02:23:02
<transcript>: I don't know. It's not activate. It's not CloudFormation.

02:23:02
<transcript>: this app

02:23:04
nate_codes: Oh I guess this is just super early EST...6AM start time?

02:23:04
<transcript>: This app, mesh, or Elastic inference.

02:23:09
<transcript>: Got one wrong. Okay, that was that mesh.

02:23:12
<transcript>: What is the.

02:23:12
<transcript>: stream schedule

02:23:14
<transcript>: Stream schedule. So.

02:23:24
<transcript>: I just changed it and I'm very sad about it because it means I'm streaming less. But my streams schedule is 07:00 a.m.. To 11:00 a.m.. Eastern.

02:23:35
<transcript>: Yeah, it's super early. Esc. No, I started. I used to start at 04:00 a.m. My time central. That was nocturnal hours.

02:23:36
madlep: Next game could be geoguessr, except figuring out where the hell you are in the AWS docs MaxLOL

02:23:38
<transcript>: And I actually had some Australians in chat.

02:23:38
<transcript>: that was that early

02:23:39
<transcript>: That was that early.

02:23:42
<transcript>: Now we do.

02:23:47
<transcript>: 06:00 a.m. My Time, which is 07:00 a.m. Eastern Yeah.

02:23:47
<transcript>: next

02:23:52
<transcript>: Next game could be geogeser except figuring out where the hell you are native.

02:23:54
<transcript>: I love it.

02:23:56
<transcript>: That's awesome.

02:23:56
nate_codes: LOL

02:24:01
<transcript>: Alright.

02:24:04
<transcript>: What's? Let's make this thing better.

02:24:04
wesleycoder: kekw

02:24:09
<transcript>: Make it a lot better it's not very good. Let's make it a lot better.

02:24:15
madlep: Australians still here BTW :D

02:24:19
<transcript>: This feels really bad. All this stuff going on in here, but it is working, although I think when I got one wrong there, let's get one wrong on purpose.

02:24:21
<transcript>: This is not.

02:24:25
<transcript>: I don't know. I don't know which one this is.

02:24:25
<transcript>: could

02:24:30
<transcript>: Could it be any of them? I don't think it's ECR. Okay. Yeah. So that's wrong.

02:24:35
<transcript>: Should show the oh, no, we didn't want to do the job. That's right.

02:24:38
<transcript>: Okay.

02:24:43
<transcript>: Man, that's Aurora. So now we just got to fix the focus problem.

02:24:45
<transcript>: So I got the quick way to see the green.

02:24:50
<transcript>: It's like it's doing a Hover. Or is it a focus? Maybe it's a focus.

02:24:56
<transcript>: Game lift.

02:24:59
<transcript>: Still still still a problem.

02:25:04
<transcript>: The pointer of insulin is not working like I expected it to work.

02:25:16
<transcript>: Matt? Leop, Are you from Australia.

02:25:16
<transcript>: what time is it there

02:25:16
nate_codes: Where's the `cn` utility from? You using classnames? Or custom version?

02:25:17
<transcript>: What time is it? There.

02:25:23
<transcript>: It's. Class Names Nate.

02:25:24
madlep: 11:13pm

02:25:26
<transcript>: natem installed

02:25:27
<transcript>: Natem installed.

02:25:41
<transcript>: Well, that's not all the Focus stuff, is it.

02:25:43
<transcript>: Ask me more. No, just the outline.

02:25:46
<transcript>: So it's not focused. It's the Hover stuff.

02:25:46
nate_codes: Did you alias it? I like the 2char version :)

02:25:52
<transcript>: So if I Oh, I bet I this is what it is.

02:26:00
<transcript>: So these need to be.

02:26:02
<transcript>: I.

02:26:02
<transcript>: need

02:26:03
<transcript>: Need.

02:26:08
<transcript>: To yank everything in here.

02:26:14
<transcript>: It needs to go in here, right.

02:26:18
beardage: mobile hover conflicts with active iirc

02:26:21
the_jolza: Another Australian still here also

02:26:29
<transcript>: Does that fix it? Kinesis. Video streams. Yep. Fixed.

02:26:29
<transcript>: all right

02:26:35
lekboks_kingyt: hi i am learning to be a good programmer can you give is an advice for the beginner 😁?

02:26:37
<transcript>: All right, so we've at least gotten back to this state. Let's fix the thing where you can just keep clicking on answers, even though you shouldn't be able to.

02:26:41
<transcript>: That's easy to right.

02:26:41
<transcript>: okay so you

02:26:44
<transcript>: Okay. So you should be able to click right there. I shouldn't have been able to do that.

02:26:47
<transcript>: So we got to disable all the buttons.

02:26:51
<transcript>: While we're in this timeout period, right.

02:26:55
<transcript>: Let's go up here.

02:27:04
<transcript>: So on Click Does on answer.

02:27:09
<transcript>: We just need to disable the buttons.

02:27:12
<transcript>: Let's see, let's think about this.

02:27:16
<transcript>: Let's disabled.

02:27:16
<transcript>: it's passed

02:27:18
<transcript>: It's passed in. Okay.

02:27:30
<transcript>: So here the Ram is disabled when answer mutation is Loading.

02:27:30
<transcript>: that's not

02:27:32
<transcript>: That's not what we want.

02:27:33
the_jolza: @lekboks_kingyt Learn the basics and start building stuff, dont spend soo much time completing course after course

02:27:35
<transcript>: We want to set like a manual.

02:27:35
<transcript>: let's see

02:27:37
<transcript>: Let's see we've got.

02:27:41
<transcript>: Handle, answer.

02:27:43
<transcript>: We set result.

02:27:43
<transcript>: and choice

02:27:44
<transcript>: And choice.

02:27:48
<transcript>: And then we set result undefined.

02:27:50
<transcript>: Here.

02:27:50
<transcript>: after

02:27:52
<transcript>: After our timeout.

02:27:55
<transcript>: We should also set Choice, I guess.

02:27:55
<transcript>: undefined

02:27:56
<transcript>: Undefined.

02:28:01
<transcript>: Okay. So here's what we do.

02:28:01
nate_codes: ^^^

02:28:02
<transcript>: If result.

02:28:02
<transcript>: is

02:28:04
<transcript>: Is undefined.

02:28:07
<transcript>: That's what disables should be, right.

02:28:10
<transcript>: Result.

02:28:15
<transcript>: results

02:28:15
<transcript>: results i keep doing everything

02:28:18
<transcript>: Results. I keep doing everything backward. It's disabled.

02:28:18
<transcript>: when the result

02:28:21
<transcript>: When the result? No, it's. I did it. I did it backwards.

02:28:21
<transcript>: oh my word

02:28:25
<transcript>: Oh, my word. Everything today is backward.

02:28:27
nate_codes: Start w/ a tutorial...with the goal of moving beyond the tutorial to your own thing ASAP. As soon as you know enough to create something you find value in, try to create your own thing. Don't stay in tutorial land for too long

02:28:29
<transcript>: Awkward day. My kid loves to do that opposite day.

02:28:33
<transcript>: Anybody else we can do opposite day just spring it on you.

02:28:33
<transcript>: leck by

02:28:39
<transcript>: Leck By welcome to Chat Another Australian Jolis Welcome Australia.

02:28:53
<transcript>: Did you Aliase it? I like the two character version. Yeah. No, I just imported it as CN. This is CN from class names I don't use like a barrel import on that one.

02:28:57
<transcript>: 11:13 P.m.. You're watching Me in Australia.

02:28:57
nate_codes: yeah that's smert

02:29:00
nate_codes: I like it

02:29:00
wesleycoder: result undefined or mutation loading

02:29:03
<transcript>: You guys are nine Owls. We are not the same. I get up very early.

02:29:03
<transcript>: and you stay up

02:29:04
<transcript>: And you stay up very late.

02:29:04
<transcript>: you're like my wife

02:29:07
<transcript>: You're like my wife. My wife is an idiot.

02:29:07
<transcript>: mobile ho

02:29:10
<transcript>: Mobile Hover conflicts with Active if I recall.

02:29:10
<transcript>: yes right

02:29:16
<transcript>: Yes. Right. Beardage. Okay, so welcome to Chat. Like Box. You said Hi. I'm learning to be a good programmer. Can you give.

02:29:16
<transcript>: an advice for

02:29:18
<transcript>: An advice for the beginner.

02:29:18
<transcript>: i don't know how

02:29:21
<transcript>: I don't know how good I am at giving advice to beginners.

02:29:21
<transcript>: i

02:29:26
<transcript>: I would say the people in Chat that are pretty good at it. I would say, just build things.

02:29:26
<transcript>: try to avoid

02:29:31
wesleycoder: if you don't disable on loading you could submit multiple

02:29:36
<transcript>: Try to avoid reading too much without building. And like deciding there's a thing you want to do. You want to build this little solution to this thing and then finding help to build that.

02:29:36
<transcript>: you learn

02:29:38
<transcript>: You learn best by doing.

02:29:42
<transcript>: Oh, there you go. Joel's is already answered.

02:29:45
<transcript>: Yes. Exactly.

02:29:50
<transcript>: Look at this. All these people in Chat. I got your back.

02:29:55
<transcript>: Result. Undefined or mutation. Loading. Oh, that's good call.

02:29:55
<transcript>: that's a good call

02:30:00
<transcript>: That's a good call. Yeah. Yeah. We need to also. So let's just undo that.

02:30:00
lekboks_kingyt: thank you so much 😊

02:30:05
<transcript>: Yeah. Let's just undo that. And let's say.

02:30:07
<transcript>: Or.

02:30:09
<transcript>: Result.

02:30:10
lekboks_kingyt: i follow you

02:30:21
<transcript>: Does not equal and define right, does not equal undefined. We wanted to disable it if the result is not undefined. Yes. Thanks for the follow lick box. I appreciate it.

02:30:27
<transcript>: You're so welcome. I don't know if I was helpful, but my chat sure was.

02:30:30
<transcript>: Oh, we saw this one earlier. What was it.

02:30:33
<transcript>: Back up Direct Connect Nimble studio.

02:30:33
<transcript>: yes

02:30:34
<transcript>: Yes.

02:30:34
<transcript>: oh

02:30:38
<transcript>: Oh, so the problem is when they're disabled the styling.

02:30:43
<transcript>: Okay.

02:30:49
wesleycoder: whoops

02:30:51
<transcript>: Oh, we got another. We got another double. Let's fix that row right now. I want that fixed right now.

02:30:55
<transcript>: It should never get create round.

02:30:58
<transcript>: Should never.

02:31:03
beardage: start keeping a list of project ideas as early as possible so you can pop stuff off the stack while you're learning. Also recommend building in public on github, it's the new resume if you want to get a job

02:31:03
<transcript>: Should never give you two of the same one, right.

02:31:14
<transcript>: That'll help me see more.

02:31:14
<transcript>: okay so

02:31:17
<transcript>: Okay, so what's wrong here? We get a random item.

02:31:18
<transcript>: Right.

02:31:18
<transcript>: and then

02:31:25
stroopwafel26: +1 for building in public

02:31:25
<transcript>: And then we get a second random item. But we we say only the resources where the name is not equal to.

02:31:28
<transcript>: The first one we just got.

02:31:29
<transcript>: Right.

02:31:32
<transcript>: We do the same thing for the third.

02:31:32
<transcript>: this is probably

02:31:36
<transcript>: This is probably there's probably way better ways to do this. But this is how I did it.

02:31:40
ankit3009: @stroopwafel26 +1

02:31:44
<transcript>: Then we say We're the Resources list. The name does not equal first name name doesn't equal second name oh, and.

02:31:51
<transcript>: That should be.

02:31:54
<transcript>: And.

02:31:54
<transcript>: oh

02:31:55
<transcript>: Oh.

02:31:57
<transcript>: And.

02:32:07
<transcript>: And you should all be Anns? So let's go back to Bar? Oh, no, that's how you go back to bar? Let's go forward to bar.

02:32:07
<transcript>: do

02:32:09
<transcript>: Do that.

02:32:11
<transcript>: And end.

02:32:11
<transcript>: go forward to

02:32:13
<transcript>: Go forward to bar again.

02:32:13
<transcript>: i do see

02:32:15
stroopwafel26: being ashamed by your own code is a good thing because it means you're improving, so don't be afraid to put everything in public repo's :)

02:32:16
<transcript>: I do see? Yeah. Okay.

02:32:19
<transcript>: And and okay.

02:32:23
<transcript>: That that should fix it. We should never get duplicates now. Right.

02:32:27
<transcript>: It was an and versus or problem.

02:32:29
<transcript>: Okay.

02:32:32
<transcript>: Back to our front end.

02:32:32
<transcript>: where we're

02:32:33
davur_: use . to redo the previous edit

02:32:36
<transcript>: Where we're so comfortable working on react.

02:32:37
<transcript>: As a joke.

02:32:42
<transcript>: We should have fixed this problem, but now the problem is disabled. Styling.

02:32:47
<transcript>: Is bad. Maybe we just don't do anything on the same styling.

02:32:47
<transcript>: we just

02:32:53
<transcript>: We just maybe we do, like pointer. Oh, yeah, yeah, we'll do the cursor. We'll do the not allowed cursor.

02:33:01
<transcript>: Dab or good call out. Thank you so much the period to redo the previous edit.

02:33:03
davur_: f|   cw&&   f| .

02:33:09
<transcript>: F.

02:33:25
<transcript>: Bar. And then C. W. And N. F. Bar. Dot. That would have been so nice. That would have been very efficient. Next time, I hope to get there. That's a great thing about them. It's such a journey. It's like, you know, you're just always on this journey. You're gonna continually get better.

02:33:28
<transcript>: And there's something very exciting about that.

02:33:33
<transcript>: Okay, let's go back to under our safe old styling.

02:33:37
beardage: yeah that's what I love, every day I feel a little better

02:33:38
<transcript>: And let's change this. We're not going to do anything with the border.

02:33:38
<transcript>: we're

02:33:40
<transcript>: We're gonna say.

02:33:47
<transcript>: All this stuff, actually, we're just gonna do the oop.

02:33:52
<transcript>: We're gonna do like this, and we're gonna say a cursor.

02:33:55
<transcript>: Not allowed. That's the only thing we're gonna change.

02:33:55
<transcript>: about the

02:33:55
beardage: you don't get that from vscode

02:33:58
<transcript>: About the styling. Is we're gonna say the Crochet's not allowed, right.

02:34:05
<transcript>: Can I move my Dev tools? There we go.

02:34:08
<transcript>: Kind of makes this a little bit bigger, okay.

02:34:08
<transcript>: i think

02:34:11
<transcript>: I think this is gonna be think, box, Frost, what do you think.

02:34:14
<transcript>: Oh, we had two of them. I forgot.

02:34:22
<transcript>: Yeah, that's a bug. When there's two of them, then it sticks around like that. We shouldn't have that anymore.

02:34:22
<transcript>: okay

02:34:25
<transcript>: Okay. That's Kinesis data analyst.

02:34:34
<transcript>: And I've got a five second delay right now. Obviously, we won't leave that. That's just for me to see the Styles. I guess we can change that now.

02:34:50
<transcript>: I guess just like 2 seconds. What's the natural like amount of time feeder like learn and what feels a bit to learn when they do this, you know, like.

02:34:50
<transcript>: if it goes

02:34:56
<transcript>: If it goes too fast, you won't learn anything. You'll just be like I got it wrong but you don't see which one was it? So this one.

02:35:04
<transcript>: Cost. Explorer. Code commit. I guess code commit. No twin maker. Oh, of course, there's like twins.

02:35:10
<transcript>: Reposted. What is this? Outpost? Rack. Distro for open telemetry.

02:35:10
<transcript>: i'm going down

02:35:12
<transcript>: I'm going down? Yeah.

02:35:21
<transcript>: So now should be able to double click that's I am now I shouldn't be able to double click I can't double click perfect. We fixed it.

02:35:27
<transcript>: That's Kubernetes EKS distro. Okay, let's start doing stuff with like score.

02:35:27
<transcript>: streaks

02:35:31
beardage: Nielson norman has a .1 / 1 / 10 sec rule

02:35:47
<transcript>: Streaks, score timers, all the game functionality that we want. The great part about this project is I'm gonna build the frontend once and we're gonna build a back end with, like, seven different stacks in the back end, so easy and so fast. But we'll have the front end already. I might make it a mono repo. We might make this a Monterefa where the front end is a package. And then we have all these different versions.

02:35:47
<transcript>: of

02:35:49
beardage: 1 sec is users flow of thought

02:35:53
<transcript>: Of the back end so we can kind of play with different stacks. This is gonna be my new like example project for everything.

02:35:57
<transcript>: I want to teach or learn a new stack. I'm gonna do it with this project.

02:36:09
<transcript>: Every day you feel a little bit better? Love it. Yeah. Via Code felt like kind of cap out, right.

02:36:14
<transcript>: One SEC is users flow of thought.

02:36:19
<transcript>: So .11 and ten second rule. Can you explain that to me.

02:36:21
<transcript>: Trying to follow.

02:36:24
<transcript>: Users flow of thought.

02:36:26
beardage: can I post a link?

02:36:27
<transcript>: That Lara bar.

02:36:27
<transcript>: barbara

02:36:29
<transcript>: Barbara was especially good today.

02:36:39
<transcript>: I think it's like I eat Lara bars sometimes. Offstream. I think on stream, they're just a little better. Something about being on stream with you all just makes life a little bit better. Everything's just a little better, you know.

02:36:43
<transcript>: I'm really gonna miss not streaming as much.

02:36:43
<transcript>: two days a week

02:36:55
<transcript>: Two days a week. It just doesn't seem like enough, but I gotta get this stuff. I gotta get some stuff off the ground. I gotta get some focus on some stuff. I might just start streaming it. We'll see if I feel like you guys would enjoy coming along. I will.

02:36:55
<transcript>: but

02:36:58
stroopwafel26: Something about eating Larabars in front of people who can't order them, so good amirite

02:37:01
<transcript>: But the plan right now is Tuesdays and Thursdays. I'm gonna stream this stuff building, random.

02:37:01
<transcript>: projects for five

02:37:01
stroopwafel26: MaxLOL

02:37:02
<transcript>: Projects for five.

02:37:02
<transcript>: and

02:37:07
<transcript>: And then Monday, Wednesday, Friday, I'll be working on my YouTube and all that stuff.

02:37:27
<transcript>: Sorry, Stroop. I forget you guys. Can I gotta put a channel point reward like I don't know how many points I have to do it to make sure I don't go broke, but have a channel point reward where I, like, send you a box of Lara bars because I understand people in Europe, some people can't order them and that really bums me out. But we can have a channel for red.

02:37:27
<transcript>: redemption where

02:37:28
stroopwafel26: YES

02:37:33
<transcript>: Redemption, where you can redeem it. And I will send you a box of your flavor of choice of Larabars.

02:37:33
<transcript>: yes

02:37:37
<transcript>: Yes, Streep is saving now he's not going to spend any more points until.

02:37:37
<transcript>: i roll that one out

02:37:39
<transcript>: I roll that one out.

02:37:39
<transcript>: this can make

02:37:41
fragaverage: *rubs hands*

02:37:45
parcodek: YESS

02:37:47
<transcript>: This can make it, like, too cheaper, like everybody's gonna be redeeming it, and I'm gonna be spending all my time instead of streaming. I'll just be shipping boxes and larvae.

02:37:47
<transcript>: for upd

02:37:48
stroopwafel26: I'm sitting on all my points now

02:37:48
<transcript>: For updates.

02:37:53
<transcript>: They are so good. They really are. I'm sorry. I'll stop talking about it.

02:37:54
beardage: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/

02:37:57
fanieldanara: Man I’m gonna have to start getting up early on Tuesdays and Thursdays, absolutely love lurking in here

02:38:02
<transcript>: Okay. I'm seeing an area here where we could.

02:38:02
<transcript>: we could

02:38:04
<transcript>: We could make this better. Right.

02:38:07
<transcript>: Let's see let's do.

02:38:14
<transcript>: Absolute.

02:38:17
<transcript>: P, three.

02:38:22
fragaverage: Have you considered going for twitch partner?

02:38:26
madlep: Never had a Larabar in Australia. We just have shrink wrapped Koalas to snack on.

02:38:27
fragaverage: You must have hit all the requirements now

02:38:34
stroopwafel26: Upside of Larabars for channel points is you're gonna get a lot less rickrolls

02:38:42
<transcript>: Then we can just say.

02:38:46
<transcript>: That thing.

02:38:53
<transcript>: If I want to just cut a character, what do I do again.

02:38:57
<transcript>: Dd cuts the line. What if I just want to cut one character.

02:39:02
davur_: x

02:39:17
<transcript>: Shrinkualist to stack on. That is hilarious. Have you considered going for Twitch partner? Yeah, Frag, I actually, I really want Twitch Partner now, early on, I didn't really know what it would get me that I would care about, but I learned not every so affiliates don't always get transcoding options, do I.

02:39:17
<transcript>: have them today

02:39:19
<transcript>: Have them today.

02:39:19
<transcript>: we had

02:39:25
<transcript>: We had a stream last week where people couldn't really there was people that couldn't watch because.

02:39:25
<transcript>: i stream

02:39:40
<transcript>: I stream in 1080 60, and they couldn't. They couldn't pull that bandwidth or whatever. And there was no transcoding. And I learned. I just learned only partners get guaranteed transcoding. So I want partners. I want it bad. How do I get partner? I just need more people showing up. I guess I got to be more interesting.

02:39:45
delvoid: you have them today

02:39:45
<transcript>: This is interesting. Maybe. I don't know. Let's come over here.

02:39:51

<transcript>: last i checked

02:40:28
nate_codes: @madlep LUL

02:40:29
fragaverage: its like 70 viewers average?

02:40:31
delvoid: you need a feet cam Kappa

02:40:35
<transcript>: Last I checked, I don't have enough concurrent viewers. I guess that's probably what everyone would be lacking. Oh, wow. Welcome to Chat, Shady Guy. I didn't see that was the first time chat. And you're coming in with.

02:40:35
<transcript>: the vim di

02:40:37

02:40:42
<transcript>: don't have

02:40:44
<transcript>: Don't have enough need more breakdown.

02:40:47
dnbull: just say html is a programming language and youll get a very active chat and its enough to convince twitch to accept you Kappa

02:40:55
<transcript>: It's 75 frag. I think I'm at like 73 or something. Say, HTML is a programming language and you'll get a very active chat.

02:40:55
fragaverage: ooooh okay

02:41:09
ryankhawkins: Haha. Truth, @dnbull

02:41:15
<transcript>: I need a feat. Cam, would that do it? Okay. Okay. Thanks for the follow. Shady guy from the internet and soy. Also, thank you for the follows. Oh and Manoo, I missed some follows. I'm so sorry. Thank you. I love it when I see new follows because I assume that means you want to come back. And as long as people keep coming back.

02:41:21
delvoid: 75 for past 30 days your at 69 :D

02:41:21
dnbull: @RyanKHawkins ;)

02:41:27
<transcript>: I enjoy streaming. It's just so fun. I love working with people here to talk to. I've said 15 years in my career, working alone in my own home office, doing my own thing, talking to no one.

02:41:31
stroopwafel26: 69 nice

02:41:38
<transcript>: 's a week ago to the grocery store. And then I have my family, obviously. But, like, yeah, it's so great to interact with people that know something about technology. Wesley Coder, thank you so much. For six months.

02:41:38

wesleycoder: maybe this helps

02:41:42
<transcript>: 69, with 69.

02:41:49
<transcript>: 75 for past 30 days. You're at 69 on. At 69. Okay. I thought it was at 70 something.

02:41:52
<transcript>: I guess it could have gone down.

02:41:58
<transcript>: Yeah, I guess if I stream less well, it might less likely to get partner. Probably, I guess.

02:41:58
<transcript>: thank you so much

02:42:04
fragaverage: @Delvoid Where is that info available publically? :O

02:42:11
<transcript>: Thank you so much in Jewel for the prime subscription. I appreciate your subscriptions so much. Just donated the first payout from Twitch this morning. So if you weren't aware, I don't hate all of the proceeds of subscriptions.

02:42:15
<transcript>: diversity

02:42:19
<transcript>: Diversity in Tech. Something I'm passionate about.

02:42:19
<transcript>: and where

02:42:24
<transcript>: And Where's that info available publicly? Yeah, I don't know. How did you know how many I have concurrently.

02:42:30
<transcript>: Type train Whoa.

02:42:37
<transcript>: Resonate thank you for the subscription. And look at this. We are on a Hype train. So much fun.

02:42:39
<transcript>: These are always fun.

02:42:39
<transcript>: a master

02:42:41
dnbull: i mean there are twitch stats website that are very detailed

02:42:44
<transcript>: A master donation, by the way. Wow. Thank you so much, Stroop. We've got matching going on.

02:42:46
<transcript>: That's awesome.

02:42:49
<transcript>: Twitch Sat switches every detail.

02:42:49
<transcript>: yeah

02:42:50
wesleycoder: 🚉

02:42:51
<transcript>: Yeah, so.

02:42:51
<transcript>: if i

02:42:54
<transcript>: If I if I stream less.

02:42:54
<transcript>: fewer days

02:42:55
<transcript>: Fewer days.

02:42:55
<transcript>: i guess

02:43:00
wesleycoder: Choo choo

02:43:04
delvoid: You can also see it on your dashboard

02:43:14
dnbull: i think 3 days a week at min over a 30 days period is enough

02:43:15
<transcript>: I guess that doesn't inherently mean it'll be harder to get partner just means that. Yeah. You guys got to keep showing up. I need you to keep showing up. I need those transcodes. And I don't even know, like, if I have 75, it's like you apply for partnership, right? It might take, like, I may not. It's may not get it. They may say no, thank you. You're not good enough. And then I have to go back to the drawing board and try to be.

02:43:15
<transcript>: better

02:43:16
<transcript>: Better.

02:43:20
<transcript>: Three days a week.

02:43:29
<transcript>: At min over 30 day period is enough. Okay, three days a week. I've definitely got the number of well, let me just pull it up. I'm gonna pull up my thing.

02:43:31
<transcript>: Let's see. Where is that.

02:43:31
<transcript>: chain

02:43:33
<transcript>: Chain all analytics.

02:43:38
<transcript>: I'm at okay average of 75 years I'm at 70.26.

02:43:43
<transcript>: Stream on twelve different days. I'm at 13 I to twelve.

02:43:43
<transcript>: so

02:43:46
<transcript>: So I got to stream enough to maintain.

02:43:46
<transcript>: twelve

02:43:48
<transcript>: Twelve out of 30 days.

02:43:48
<transcript>: which means

02:43:52
<transcript>: Which means, yeah, three days a week. I'm after three days week. You heard it here.

02:43:52
<transcript>: two days

02:43:59
<transcript>: Two days isn't gonna work. We'll fix it. I'll do Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday stream for 25 hours. I got that one covered.

02:43:59
<transcript>: like

02:44:00
dnbull: So in summary: sell your soul to twitch Kappa

02:44:02
<transcript>: Like 63 hours out of 25.

02:44:02
<transcript>: so

02:44:04
<transcript>: So there you go.

02:44:04
<transcript>: there you go

02:44:09
<transcript>: There you go. Thank you. West Dakota, for gifting to Dan Bowl. Thank you so much.

02:44:10
dnbull: @wesleycoder Thanks for the gift sub!

02:44:11
<transcript>: Appreciate that.

02:44:15
<transcript>: In summary, sell your soul to Twitch.

02:44:16
stroopwafel26: HYPE

02:44:21
<transcript>: I love doing this like I love streaming. Genuinely love it a hype train woo.

02:44:24
<transcript>: I would I would stream it every single day. Honestly.

02:44:24
<transcript>: if

02:44:29
wesleycoder: adamdo8DealWithIt

02:44:31
<transcript>: If it made money, but I'm trying to get away from consulting and to do that, I'm gonna try.

02:44:31
<transcript>: kind of

02:44:39
<transcript>: Kind of changing my career path. I've been just a consultant for years, and now I'm gonna be an educated.

02:44:39
<transcript>: and i don't know what that means

02:44:40
<transcript>: And I don't know what that means.

02:44:40
<transcript>: but i want

02:44:43
stroopwafel26: love new subs because it means more money to good causes <3

02:44:45
<transcript>: But I want to try and make an income as an educator, and I kind of got to get that off the ground. I don't know if I can do that while I streaming.

02:44:45
<transcript>: if i can

02:44:48
<transcript>: If I can I'll stream every day.

02:44:48
<transcript>: but

02:44:55
<transcript>: But I'm not gonna create YouTube content and educational content, probably on stream at first, just while I kind of feel it out.

02:45:00
<transcript>: That's right. More subs. More money to good causes. Okay.

02:45:07
dendenguy: Backend consultant or?

02:45:10
<transcript>: So we actually fix some stuff. This thing's looking pretty good. We're gonna make it. We're actually build like functionality now. Not just like fixed bugs that we introduced.

02:45:27
<transcript>: Yeah, I mostly didn't. I mostly do like, AWS work. I'm an AWS hero. I do a lot of, like, DevOpsy things back in work. I have built some full stack apps for clients. I try not to do that anymore just because I take forever. Clearly, I take forever to build front end stuff.

02:45:35
<transcript>: So the ROI of my time is not great and they could find better people to build their front ends, but Yeah.

02:45:35
<transcript>: i have

02:45:46
<transcript>: I have a path as like an entrepreneur. So I do a lot of work with startups. I advise some stuff startups because people know I've done that before and raised money and done all that stuff.

02:45:50
<transcript>: Wait a minute. What just happened? Something. I just got a.

02:45:50
<transcript>: my ear

02:47:15
finitesingularity: Thanks for the SO. :)

02:47:16
wesleycoder: have y'all tried fig? I'm in love with its autocomplete features

02:47:16
<transcript>: Like Neil. Them.

02:47:27
2dorkstv: lol. Destiny 2 is *just* like neovim

02:47:29
<transcript>: Have you tried fig? I'm gonna love it. I don't believe features. I have not Wesley. I've heard I've heard good things from fig of fig.

02:47:29
<transcript>: yeah we're just gonna

02:47:32
<transcript>: Yeah, we're just gonna fix this. I'm gonna just consolidate this a little bit.

02:47:32
<transcript>: so

02:47:33
nate_codes: Oh interesting...it picks up on the latest tag the stream had. that was a 4.5hr stream where I played D2 for like the last 30 mins lol

02:47:35
<transcript>: So I'm gonna go.

02:47:35
<transcript>: like

02:47:37
<transcript>: Like this thing. I'm gonna exit.

02:47:37
<transcript>: paste

02:47:37
nate_codes: @2DorksTV LUL

02:47:40
<transcript>: Paste it here. Kind of.

02:47:43
<transcript>: Oh, this could be based on the state right.

02:47:43
<transcript>: so let's

02:47:45
<transcript>: So let's see.

02:47:45
<transcript>: see like this

02:47:47
<transcript>: See like this.

02:47:49
<transcript>: I like that.

02:47:49
<transcript>: like

02:47:51
<transcript>: Like that.

02:47:51
<transcript>: like

02:47:56
<transcript>: Like that. Okay. We're gonna copy that. Just gonna jank it. And then I'm gonna go.

02:48:01
<transcript>: Way over here, and I'm gonna say, paste.

02:48:05
<transcript>: So if state is error, we put that thing in there.

02:48:05
nate_codes: I enjoy several games and frequently take a coding break / end stream with some gaming decompress time

02:48:08
<transcript>: Right.

02:48:13
stroopwafel26: @2DorksTV I do all my coding in Destiny 2

02:48:15
finitesingularity: @wesleycoder You say fig, and I start having flashbacks to xfig..  definitely not as impressive.. (xfig that is)

02:48:16
<transcript>: And then if what do I do? What did I do.

02:48:19
<transcript>: If state is error and that.

02:48:20
wesleycoder: ternary?

02:48:20
<transcript>: Oh.

02:48:23
nate_codes: Destiny/Apex/Fortnite/League depending on how much I hate myself that day

02:48:29
<transcript>: I guess. I guess I can't do that. Just a single character. Can I? So I have to like, quote it.

02:48:32
<transcript>: Yeah, yeah? There we go.

02:48:38
<transcript>: And then we want to do same thing. But if state is success.

02:48:39
nate_codes: @2DorksTV Typescript is just a Vex simulation

02:48:43
<transcript>: We're gonna do this one.

02:48:45
<transcript>: Right.

02:48:46
stroopwafel26: lol

02:48:49
<transcript>: And then I'm going to paste it.

02:48:49
<transcript>: there's probably

02:48:54
<transcript>: There's probably better ways to do all that. Okay, now I can delete all the lines, right.

02:48:57
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:49:08
<transcript>: Okay. I think that's better. Now, what is this one? This is application together. Discovery Service. Oh, no, I broke it. Oh, Geez, did I really break it.

02:49:09
nate_codes: That's why there's no language spec...secretly TS is only truly understood by warminds

02:49:13
<transcript>: What's this gonna be? Device defender? No, I didn't bring it. We're good.

02:49:13
<transcript>: cool

02:49:16
<transcript>: Cool that's Kinesis Fire hose.

02:49:27
<transcript>: Okay. And let's make sure we can. Is that managed blockchain? No, I can't click on any others. Perfect. Oops. I just guessed, and I got that one right. That was awesome.

02:49:31
<transcript>: Level One High trainer mode. Alright.

02:49:31
<transcript>: thanks everybody

02:49:33
<transcript>: Thanks everybody for the Hype train.

02:49:37
<transcript>: You do all your coding and destiny.

02:49:48
<transcript>: It's just like me of him.

02:49:51
laytanl_: HypeCheer HypePurr

02:49:52
<transcript>: So it gets the last okay. I see.

02:49:52
<transcript>: the last tag you

02:49:53
<transcript>: The last tag you had.

02:49:58
<transcript>: Yeah, no, I wish.

02:50:04
wesleycoder: you are in front of the browser rn we can't see the buttons

02:50:04
stroopwafel26: bashGo

02:50:15
<transcript>: I could stream me playing games. I don't think I'm gonna be able to stream myself playing games because I don't play game. I can't play games if I play game, I'm addicted. I'm not addictive. I have an addictive personality, and I know that about myself. And I'm not allowed to play games anymore because.

02:50:15
<transcript>: i get

02:50:16
kedemel: Same.

02:50:19
<transcript>: I get super into them like it's bad.

02:50:19
<transcript>: i can

02:50:25
kedemel: World of Warcraft kills me.

02:50:28
<transcript>: I can fail that of College because I didn't go to any classes first semester, because I just played World Warcraft for an entire semester was a giant waste of money.

02:50:28
<transcript>: turn area

02:50:28
nate_codes: Been there

02:50:34
<transcript>: Turn area. Yeah. Good call with the coder. We could do a ternary here. I just. I didn't like the turn area. Would be like.

02:50:35
iamreda: miss Dofus

02:50:36
<transcript>: Two different States.

02:50:40
2dorkstv: oof. I'm real glad I had crappy internet when WoW was big

02:50:47
<transcript>: Like it's. There's three States, there's error, success, and then undefined. And since it's three of them, I felt the turning would be kind of ugly.

02:50:47
<transcript>: i thought this

02:50:49
<transcript>: I thought this was a little easier to see.

02:50:49
<transcript>: it'll never

02:50:55
<transcript>: It'll never be both States, so only one of them will show. But like if we did the turn area, it would be.

02:50:55
<transcript>: question mark

02:51:00
<transcript>: Question Mark that else state equals success, that else.

02:51:02
<transcript>: And I just felt bad.

02:51:02
<transcript>: so that's why we did that

02:51:04
<transcript>: So that's why we did that. I think we stick with it.

02:51:09
stroopwafel26: I'm real glad I was working on Linux kernel dev when WoW was big so I didn't have time for games

02:51:11
ohmymndy: My god I feel I am so slow today, it is so getting used to this Kinesis Advantage... But it is an awesome keyboard nonetheless

02:51:11
trout_soda: so now's a bad time to bring up that WoW Classic is launching Wrath of the Lich King in a week?

02:51:12
<transcript>: Okay, destiny. Apex fortnight League. Depending on how much time I have and then in touch with just a Vex simulation. What a. I don't know what you get talking about.

02:51:12
nate_codes: I got pulled back in during classic...luckily life is too busy / good right now to justify MMO time so I suspended all of my subs before WOTLK launch :P

02:51:18
<transcript>: Front of the browser. Right now, we can't see the buttons. Oh, no, I'm in front of the browser. Of course you are.

02:51:18
<transcript>: you guys

02:51:21
<transcript>: You guys can't play long if I'm covering up.

02:51:21
<transcript>: the button

02:51:24
<transcript>: The buttons. Can you see them now.

02:51:28
<transcript>: Yeah, we're Warcraft was bad. It was bad for me.

02:51:39
<transcript>: I had crappy it yeah, I didn't have great internet, but I still found a way.

02:51:40
wesleycoder: I also have addiction problems, but instead of avoiding it I'm diving deeper and becoming a game developer ke

02:51:44
wesleycoder: 😂

02:51:47
<transcript>: Feel so slow today? What's wrong, Mandy? Getting used to can you? Oh, the Kinesis advantage. Ooh.

02:51:47
<transcript>: awesome key

02:51:51
nate_codes: @OhMyMndy How long have you had it? Learning curve for new layouts can take even a month or more....

02:51:57
<transcript>: Awesome keyboard. You're loving it. Yeah, I'm gonna get a so I've got I've got an Advantage 360 coming, which I understand a lot of you are not in the US, and you're not able to order them.

02:52:00
nate_codes: Don't feel bad! The muscle memory will come

02:52:01
iamreda: have you tried Metin2 ?

02:52:03
ohmymndy: Talking about games, I bought Lawnmower simulator this weekend, can't wait to play it

02:52:14
<transcript>: I don't know if I'm gonna use it because honestly, I'm just not a split keyboard kind of guy. The aesthetics of it is just I can't. I don't know. I just can't. I really like the look of a normal keyboard. And half of what I do is about aesthetics.

02:52:14
<transcript>: so

02:52:15
<transcript>: So.

02:52:15
<transcript>: it's very important

02:52:28
<transcript>: It's very important to me, so I may not. I may not want to use the split keyboard. There are a few options. Also, it might not sound good if it doesn't sound good. I'm also out. You can't change the switches on them. Like there's some reasons I might just be out, but I ordered it because prime uses it.

02:52:28
<transcript>: and

02:52:43
<transcript>: And also because they had, like, an outage that day, like you couldn't get on their page. It was crashing some of traffic. And whenever there's something like that, you bet I'm gonna span that button, like indefinitely until I can order the thing, like, Scarcity. I've just got a reptile brain, right.

02:52:43
ohmymndy: @nate_codes Just today, I am aware of that indeed.. Also want to switch to dvorak later down the road

02:52:43
stroopwafel26: @OhMyMndy Make sure you also play powerwash simulator

02:52:54
<transcript>: So I ordered one and it's possible I won't use it. There are a few things I could do. It one. I could put it on display because it's cool. It's a cool thing to have, I guess.

02:52:54
<transcript>: but it'd be

02:52:57
<transcript>: But it'd be a shame for such a nice keyboard to not be used.

02:52:57
nate_codes: @OhMyMndy Yeah I've been using VIM for ~7 years and still haven't made the dvorak jump

02:53:02
ohmymndy: @stroopwafel26 Is it worth it?

02:53:05
nate_codes: Thinking about picking up Workman or Colemak-dh

02:53:08
<transcript>: So I could give it away. I've thought about that. I thought about doing a giveaway it'd be great for some of the folks in the EU who can't order it to have a chance. Not just the EU, Australia, wherever you are.

02:53:11
<transcript>: Type a chance at one.

02:53:11
<transcript>: we did a

02:53:14
stroopwafel26: @stroopwafel26 it's very relaxing

02:53:16
<transcript>: We did a giveaway on stream for my 1000 followers. What would I do? What.

02:53:16
<transcript>: i feel like

02:53:20
<transcript>: I feel like doing it for 20 followers is just a little too like.

02:53:20
<transcript>: i don't know

02:53:24
<transcript>: I don't know 2000 and so arbitrary.

02:53:33
nate_codes: @OhMyMndy high key best game of 2022. My wife and I both have completed the campaign and it's unironically one of my favorite gaming experiences

02:53:36
trout_soda: 2,222 followers?

02:53:37
<transcript>: So we could do it like as a giveaway on stream or we could do it as a giveaway on Twitter. Something. I don't know. I don't know if anyone has ideas. We could do it some way to benefit charity, like do an auction.

02:53:37
<transcript>: benefit charity

02:53:38
finitesingularity: 2048 follower giveaway

02:53:40
ohmymndy: 5000 subs and put this huge sub goal bar on screen

02:53:42
<transcript>: Benefit Charity Would people pay a lot in an auction for one.

02:53:50
<transcript>: I don't know. We'll see 5000 subs. Put this huge sub gold bar on screen. I've seen the sub. The sub goal thing.

02:53:51
<transcript>: I've seen that.

02:53:51
<transcript>: where people have

02:54:01
<transcript>: Where people have like number of subs on their stream Binja I saw has like 84 out of 85 and it does make me want to sad. I want to see what happens. You know when we hit that goal.

02:54:07
<transcript>: 2048 follow I do like I like the powers of two. I will say.

02:54:09
ohmymndy: @nate_codes You are talking about lawnmower simulator, right?

02:54:15
nate_codes: @nate_codes powerwash simulator

02:54:21
nate_codes: WIll have to get Lawnmower simulator next!!

02:54:27
<transcript>: That's awesome. Finite. That's funny. The other day, I realized I stopped doing my podcast. I have a podcast, AWS FM, and I've taken a couple of unofficial breaks, and I realized I recently stopped one. And part of the psychology for me was I was on 32. I had done 32 episodes, and I was like, hey, that's a nice power of two. Take a little break.

02:54:30
finitesingularity: :D

02:54:35
<transcript>: Yeah. So we'll see we might give it away if anybody has any.

02:54:35
<transcript>: suggestions

02:54:37
<transcript>: Suggestions on the giveaway.

02:54:37
<transcript>: if i get

02:54:39
ohmymndy: Ah nice, I am curious to know how those compare for you :-)

02:54:42
nate_codes: As a dad I realized what I enjoy in games has changed....virtual cleaning and yard work are lit AF

02:54:49
<transcript>: If I get it away we'll see when it gets here we'll unbox it on stream, we'll play with it, see if I can get used to it, if I can handle the aesthetics I just love my keyboard so much and I can't imagine using a slip keyboard, but.

02:54:49
<transcript>: we'll see

02:54:50
<transcript>: We'll see.

02:55:03
stroopwafel26: When I was playing powerwash simulator I got weird looks from my wife "you're using the most powerful game console for... this?"

02:55:03
<transcript>: All right, all the lines, main and Danny blend and water and bowls of water. I've got a pee again, so I'm gonna take quick break. I'll be right back.

02:55:12
ohmymndy: What is this for lofi Toto Africa?

02:55:36
ohmymndy: @stroopwafel26 Haha that is funny, and she got into the game as well later?

02:55:53
stroopwafel26: my wife doesn't touch the xbox, she has a switch

02:55:58
kedemel: @stroopwafel26 YO, my wife jumped on with me and got obsessed.

02:56:10
kedemel: We beat it and now she just goes back and redoes all the missions lol

02:56:13
ohmymndy: Is it also multiplayer?

02:56:18
stroopwafel26: yeah

02:56:25
ohmymndy: Oh wow that is awesome

02:56:27
nate_codes: @stroopwafel26 My wife was jealous and made me gift her on steam

02:56:38
stroopwafel26: I sometimes powerwash some stuff with my brother in law

02:56:42
ohmymndy: Can't wait for my work day to be over :-D

02:56:52
stroopwafel26: @stroopwafel26 so extortion

02:56:54
nate_codes: Sometimes the best way to end a long day is just powerwashing a purple dinosaur playground with my wife...

02:57:03
kedemel: @nate_codes true lol

02:57:12
nate_codes: Skate park is definitely my fav

02:57:18
ohmymndy: I really like Jurassic Park, and saw that there are some maps with dinosaurs in Lawnmower Simulator, so that is what sold me I guess

02:57:21
nate_codes: but I like playing skateboards so that makes sense

02:57:26
stroopwafel26: I liked the gigantic fountain

02:57:36
nate_codes: @OhMyMndy love it!

02:57:40
<transcript>: Alright.

02:57:44
nate_codes: @adamdotdev I'm waiting for the Kinesis partner (Upgrade Keyboards) to get it with custom switches. I'm a Zeal addict...literally can't type on any other switches now.

02:57:46
<transcript>: Can't wait for my work day to be over. I'm just kind of reading, read and chat.

02:57:52
<transcript>: Why you guys are talking about lots of stuff. I missed it. I missed it all.

02:57:58
<transcript>: Okay. So I just saw them on Twitter, and I had to comment on it. Oh, wait, wait.

02:57:58
<transcript>: what is this

02:58:06
<transcript>: What is this? I'm waiting for the Kinesis Partner upgrade keyboards to get it with custom switches. Zeal Addict literally can't type on any other switches. Now.

02:58:06
<transcript>: ooh

02:58:08
<transcript>: Ooh your bougie.

02:58:25
<transcript>: I've got some Zeal switches. Zelios? I don't remember which keyboard I put Zel switches on. The problem is, I'm not good at looping switches. And I don't know if I care to learn because it's just like a whole thing. And I love my mechanical keyboards. I love them. They're fantastic.

02:58:25
<transcript>: but

02:58:28
<transcript>: But the most learn a whole new skill that takes.

02:58:31
<transcript>: Hundreds of hours of mastery.

02:58:31
<transcript>: just do

02:58:32
ohmymndy: This is my first mechanical keyboard (it has Cherry mx Red silent), so far I like them

02:58:32
nate_codes: yeah I still gotta lube them...but even unlubed they own my lubed glorious pandas. Zero comparison

02:58:34
<transcript>: Just do much. I don't have that time, but.

02:58:36
<transcript>: They're not.

02:58:38
<transcript>: Nice.

02:58:38
<transcript>: my first

02:58:43
<transcript>: My first mechanical keyboard has cherry MX Red silent. Okay, alright.

02:58:45
<transcript>: Still gonna lose them even unlike.

02:58:45
<transcript>: ooh

02:58:46
nate_codes: I really wanna get the Zeal crystals and lube them...

02:58:48
<transcript>: Ooh, I've got some glorious pandas too.

02:58:48
<transcript>: we

02:58:56
nate_codes: good tactile man

02:58:58
<transcript>: We are the same, Nate. We got lots of similar interests. I've got boxes of switches that I don't use, but it's like, oh, these are good switches. I need to have some of those.

02:59:05
ohmymndy: Don't forget to lube up first gents, lolz

02:59:08
<transcript>: Yeah, these these are actually mode tactile switches on this keyboard and I don't know if they're good, but they sound fantastic.

02:59:11
<transcript>: Don't forget to leave up.

02:59:11
<transcript>: so

02:59:18
<transcript>: So I saw something on Twitter and I want to comment on it. My friend dad, who you've seen on Stream if you've been here very much.

02:59:20
finitesingularity: I just got my first non-crap keyboard a few weeks back.  Trying *really* hard not to get sucked into this rabbit hole now.. :D

02:59:27
<transcript>: I saw him tweet that like basically all the arguments in Tech are about.

02:59:27
<transcript>: people

02:59:35
<transcript>: People from like later stage companies bewildered at the way people do things at pre.

02:59:35
<transcript>: preproduct

02:59:42
<transcript>: Preproduct market fit companies. I'm botching the Tweet, but it's something that I very much have now resonate with.

02:59:42
<transcript>: like

02:59:45
<transcript>: Like any advice you see on Twitter or on the internet.

02:59:45
<transcript>: it's so

02:59:57
<transcript>: It's so hard to wrap up all the context into the advice that's given. So when people are like, Ah Kubernetes is terrible or TerraForm EW like those are things I've said.

02:59:57
<transcript>: when i say

02:59:58
nate_codes: My progression was Cherry MX Brown > Kailh Purple Pro > Glorious Panda Lubed > Glorious Lynx (ew) > Zeal (permawin)

03:00:07
ohmymndy: Docker, eww

03:00:13
<transcript>: When I say those things, it's because I work alone or I work with tiny startups or like, five people. And of course, I don't think Kubernetes makes any sense because in my world it doesn't. But if you work at some huge company where you have reasons, yeah. Docker OOH. Exactly. Mandy. Another thing I said.

03:00:13
<transcript>: i know

03:00:22
<transcript>: I know you're a container person, Mandy, and that makes sense for you because of the context you live in. So that's the thing about tech, so much tech out there.

03:00:22
<transcript>: and so

03:00:24
<transcript>: And so many use cases.

03:00:24
<transcript>: and it's very hard

03:00:33
<transcript>: And it's very hard when you live in one little specific corner of the tech universe to take into consideration all these other contexts that people live in.

03:00:33
<transcript>: and that's

03:00:43
<transcript>: And that's where I think most of the conflict comes in. People are like, how could you want to work from home? How could you not want to work from home? It's like we all have very different contexts. That's all. I don't know.

03:00:43
<transcript>: said to

03:00:48
<transcript>: Said to say that just expand on that. Just follow DAX th.

03:00:48
<transcript>: dx

03:00:52
ohmymndy: Haha, Dockerizing an container with openssh server at the moment for a demo for tomorrow (Jetbrains gateway over ssh)

03:00:53
stroopwafel26: WFH 4 ever for me, thanks

03:00:54
<transcript>: Dxr or XDR. Something like that. Back to the best. Okay.

03:01:01
<transcript>: Yeah. I work for a home for me forever, too.

03:01:01
<transcript>: i've always

03:01:03
<transcript>: I've always worked from home.

03:01:05
<transcript>: I can't imagine changing that.

03:01:07
kedemel: There was a podcast with the tech lead at StackOverflow and to hear they use virtually none of these technologies is pretty interesting.

03:01:11
<transcript>: For basically any reason there are zero reasons. There's one reason I might take a job.

03:01:11
<transcript>: then i would

03:01:18
stroopwafel26: 0 reasons to go outside ever

03:01:22
<transcript>: Then I would be if someone would pay me just to be on Twitter all day with you all. If someone would pay me to do that, I'd consider it, but that would be working from home. So there's zero chance I will ever not work from home as long as I'm able.

03:01:23
ohmymndy: WFH 4 ever indeed, just bought a proper chair, 4K 32inch screen and a proper keyboard. It is just great

03:01:26
2dorkstv: I prefer to use podman over Docker. no daemon or root required. it's great

03:01:28
<transcript>: There's a piecast with a tech lead at stackroflow into huge.

03:01:37
<transcript>: Virtually none of these technologies just bring interesting. Yeah. I mean stack overville what that's built with like, ASP. Net or something.

03:01:43
ryankhawkins: @OhMyMndy Nice

03:01:43
<transcript>: Yeah, it's funny. There's a lot of ways to build successful tech company.

03:01:43
<transcript>: and

03:01:48
<transcript>: And there are no right answers. So be wary of anybody who's, like, here's the right answer.

03:01:53
<transcript>: There are reasons to go outside every exactly. I never go outside.

03:01:53
<transcript>: i should

03:01:54
<transcript>: I should.

03:01:58
kedemel: Yea, .NET Core. No Docker, Kubernetes. They have physical servers.

03:02:01
<transcript>: Alright.

03:02:07
<transcript>: Let's add some actual functionality. I guess I want to like commit some stuff.

03:02:15
ohmymndy: @2DorksTV That is true, but I really miss the advanced networking stuff. I quite often create separate networks so containers can only access other containers they really have to access

03:02:16
<transcript>: Oh, we have any commits. This is the first commit. Everyone.

03:02:20
<transcript>: Get submit.

03:02:25
<transcript>: Sure. Initial commit. Clearly. I've been this before.

03:02:27
stroopwafel26: @2DorksTV this

03:02:28
<transcript>: Okay.

03:02:32
<transcript>: And we probably don't have a remote either. Look at this.

03:02:32
<transcript>: haven't even create

03:02:35
<transcript>: Haven't even created a remote for AW guess yet.

03:02:40
<transcript>: Github. Let's do this new repository.

03:02:44
<transcript>: I guess I should use like the GitHub CLI.

03:02:44
<transcript>: did i get it

03:02:45
<transcript>: Did I get it.

03:02:46
beardage: not into fugitive?

03:02:48
<transcript>: There's a nap that won't get off me.

03:02:51
<transcript>: Oh.

03:02:54
<transcript>: Actually, I killed it.

03:02:54
<transcript>: and

03:02:55
<transcript>: And.

03:02:59
<transcript>: I got on my fingers and I'm OCPD, and that bothers me a lot.

03:02:59
<transcript>: it also bothers

03:03:01
kedemel: D:

03:03:03
<transcript>: It also bothers me that killed it. I guess I should be bothered. I'm a vegan.

03:03:06
<transcript>: Bugs just. I don't know for some reason.

03:03:08
<transcript>: Doesn't apply to me.

03:03:16
<transcript>: Okay. Was it in. Oh, yeah. I was creating a repository. Repository name.

03:03:21
<transcript>: Aw guess.

03:03:22
<transcript>: Public.

03:03:24
tafiir: bugs intrude in you personal space

03:03:28
2dorkstv: @OhMyMndy I think you can do that kind of thing by bunching all your containers into one pod? but it might not be a 1:1 thing there. My local stuff is pretty simple most of the time

03:03:29
ohmymndy: Talking about Podman, it really frustrates me that (with Docker) bind mounts mess up the file/folder permissions. Podman solves that with those subid subgid or someting? Meaning that still not all files are owned by the user running?

03:03:42
turklerburada: !awguess

03:03:43
<transcript>: Say I'm a vegan. I'm a plant based eater. I guess I don't get too much into like, I mean, I it's made me care a lot more about animal rights and the environment than I did before we became plant based eaters. But the primary reason that I am vegan is not to tell people I'm vegan. It's that we like eating plants. And we think.

03:03:43
<transcript>: it's best for

03:03:48
<transcript>: It's best for our health. We've been doing it almost ten years now. We're coming up on our ten year anniversary.

03:03:48
<transcript>: aw

03:03:53
stroopwafel26: @OhMyMndy you can also do this in docker

03:03:54
tafiir: im vegan too, and especially mosquitos got to go

03:03:55
<transcript>: Aw, guess, Turkler, welcome to Chat. I do need a command for eight of you guess. Aw, guess I'll just tell you right now.

03:03:58
<transcript>: To quickly create new commands. Let's do let's see here.

03:04:03
<transcript>: Especially mosquitoes got to go from a fellow vegan.

03:04:03
<transcript>: i respect

03:04:05
<transcript>: I respect that to fever.

03:04:05
<transcript>: let's

03:04:08
<transcript>: Let's do fat Sabot.

03:04:19
<transcript>: I need to be able to do this fast. I know there's a way to do it from the command, like from the actual chat. We're just gonna do it this way, so. Aw, guess.

03:04:22
<transcript>: Aw guess.

03:04:27
<transcript>: Is a guessing game.

03:04:32
<transcript>: Where your given and AWS.

03:04:32
<transcript>: service

03:04:37
<transcript>: Service icon and you have to choose the correct service.

03:04:42
<transcript>: There you go.

03:04:42
<transcript>: now it should work

03:04:43
<transcript>: Now it should work.

03:04:46
<transcript>: Welcome to chat.

03:04:51
ohmymndy: @stroopwafel26 That is true, but lots of messing with those subuid subgid ranges and stuff. I just want files in the container be mine on the host...

03:04:51
turklerburada: let me try LUL

03:04:56
turklerburada: !awguess

03:04:56
fossabot: awguess is a guessing game where you're given an AWS service icon and you have to choose the correct service

03:05:01
<transcript>: Yeah, tougher. Your bugs intrude on your personal space. I guess so do animals sometimes, but like, I wouldn't kill an animal.

03:05:04
<transcript>: If they intruded on my personal space.

03:05:04
<transcript>: i don't know

03:05:06
<transcript>: I don't know what it is about bugs.

03:05:08
<transcript>: That I just don't respect.

03:05:13
<transcript>: Your remote ad. I really should. I bet my wife is more.

03:05:13
<transcript>: is more

03:05:14
<transcript>: Is more.

03:05:22
<transcript>: See animal more. Aws, I bet she's more into saving the bugs.

03:05:25
<transcript>: Okay, get push.

03:05:26
stroopwafel26: @stroopwafel26 for local testing i sometimes just use the id of my local user and insert that

03:05:30
<transcript>: Get push set up stream origin yeah Yeah.

03:05:36
<transcript>: I hope there's nothing sensitive. Og. Did I have any secrets in this thing? Surely not.

03:05:36
<transcript>: i'm

03:05:42
<transcript>: I'm surely smart enough to not just like, dump secrets into my repos. Now, right.

03:05:44
<transcript>: Now we're about to find out.

03:05:47
<transcript>: About to find out.

03:05:50
<transcript>: I am new.

03:05:50
<transcript>: those don't

03:05:53
<transcript>: Those don't need to be there. I am new to the.

03:05:53
<transcript>: t three

03:05:56
<transcript>: T three stack so.

03:05:57
<transcript>: It's possible.

03:06:01
ohmymndy: @stroopwafel26 Meaning that you say 33 in the container is 1000 on the host or something?

03:06:07
<transcript>: I don't think I did. I don't know. I think we're good. Are there any secrets? Even. I don't know if there's any secrets involved in this project.

03:06:11
<transcript>: Let's just let's do this.

03:06:13
<transcript>: Let's do.

03:06:15
<transcript>: E M.

03:06:15
<transcript>: yeah

03:06:21
<transcript>: Yeah, there are secrets, but they're in that ends. And that's not checked in, right? Yeah, we're good.

03:06:23
<transcript>: We're good.

03:06:23
<transcript>: okay

03:06:25
<transcript>: Okay.

03:06:25
<transcript>: now let's build

03:06:29
<transcript>: Now let's build some functionality. What do you say? Hey, this is up on the Internet. Now.

03:06:32
<transcript>: Let's.

03:06:32
<transcript>: add

03:06:36
<transcript>: Add to our AW guest command. We could add this.

03:06:42
<transcript>: Save. Okay.

03:06:48
<transcript>: And then I guess I could do like the today I should start doing that today thing. Where's today.

03:06:56
<transcript>: I mean, the days almost over, but I should probably do why not have it today? Oh, project I've been I have it alias on project.

03:06:59
<transcript>: Yeah. Today. Okay.

03:06:59
<transcript>: building

03:07:00
<transcript>: Building.

03:07:00
<transcript>: aw

03:07:02
<transcript>: Aw guess.

03:07:08
stroopwafel26: @stroopwafel26  UID=$(id -u)

03:07:08
<transcript>: We.

03:07:11
ohmymndy: Solution for me at the moment (which works for Docker, Podman and what have you) is to just use bindfs (fuse) to mount over the storage directory on the host with force permissions with my user and group id. Have to check the performance of that, but will create a post on my dev.to blog later I think

03:07:13
<transcript>: T three sack.

03:07:28
<transcript>: Okay. You guys are still talking about containers or something.

03:07:31
<transcript>: I'm gonna just keep on moving.

03:07:38
<transcript>: Okay, well, let's see. We can create a new game.

03:07:45
<transcript>: And we can guess. Let's do the timer. We started the timer. Let's actually finish the timer.

03:07:49
<transcript>: Let's see. Where is that timer? It's right there.

03:07:53
<transcript>: So this the width of this thing.

03:07:54
<transcript>: Right here.

03:07:57
<transcript>: Is dynamic.

03:07:57
<transcript>: so

03:08:00
<transcript>: So the way we're gonna do that is.

03:08:02
<transcript>: With style.

03:08:06
<transcript>: We're gonna say width.

03:08:12
<transcript>: Like if I do that now it's that yeah. So then if I do 200.

03:08:18
<transcript>: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thanks so much. It's Buick. Thank you for the follow. I appreciate that.

03:08:35
itsboek: Woo finally catching you live

03:08:38
<transcript>: I really do. I don't want to like, go through the motions and just be like, thank you for I really do appreciate your follow a genuinely do because that means you'll be back. I think if you follow me, I can't think of any other motivation for following other than you want to make sure and come back when I stream again. And I would love for you to come back because I love interacting with you on chat.

03:08:38
<transcript>: please

03:08:46
<transcript>: Please say hey, oh, you did finally catching you live. Thank you so much for coming into Chat. Tomo. Tomo from Earth.

03:08:46
<transcript>: is

03:08:47
tomofromearth___: Howdy!

03:08:50
<transcript>: Is here. Tomo. Is.

03:09:02
tomofromearth___: Kinder coder

03:09:05
tomofromearth___: Correcto!

03:09:08
<transcript>: New to the web development community, but he is old to the music community. Is that the way to say that Tomo, you're a musician formally of 30 seconds from Mars, and he's now big into Webdev and welcome him into our community. Howdy yes, kinda coder.

03:09:09
nate_codes: Ayyy its' @TomoFromEarth___!!!

03:09:15
ohmymndy: Welcome to the stream and to the kind dev community at adamdotdev and soon watchdotdev!

03:09:19
itsboek: Woah crazy

03:09:19
nate_codes: Theo was super starstruck when he found out you like his vids @TomoFromEarth___

03:09:21
<transcript>: It's Boak. Do I know you from Twitter? It's Boek. Also. Thank you for the follow Bella, Bella Claw and Turkler Barretta. I bought you everyone's name. I'm so sorry.

03:09:24
itsboek: Yeah I’m Theo spaces

03:09:27
turklerburada: you did great

03:09:30
<transcript>: Theeo was Superstar shark.

03:09:30
itsboek: In*

03:09:33
abdullahicyc: hey Adam

03:09:38
<transcript>: Tomo, you stream.

03:09:38
<transcript>: i didn't know

03:09:39
<transcript>: I didn't know you streamed.

03:09:40
abdullahicyc: hows your day going ?

03:09:42
<transcript>: I'm following you.

03:09:44
<transcript>: You're a streamer.

03:09:44
<transcript>: you stream

03:09:45
<transcript>: You stream.

03:09:47
tomofromearth___: @nate_codes Really?  I’m Star struck of him lol.  He’s the reason I started doing a weekly project.

03:09:49
<transcript>: Hey, Abdula, my day is going well.

03:09:49
<transcript>: we are

03:09:51
<transcript>: We are.

03:09:51
<transcript>: we're building

03:09:53
<transcript>: We're building AW guess.

03:09:53
<transcript>: and

03:09:56
tomofromearth___: I used to stream a lot.  I kinda quit.

03:10:01
<transcript>: And the only thing it's not going well is I've started streaming less, and it bums me out to my core, like genuinely.

03:10:01
ohmymndy: "i am following you", totally not creepy :-)

03:10:01
<transcript>: i would

03:10:12
<transcript>: I would stream all day every day if I could, but I'm doing two days a week now, and it's been five days since I streamed. And that wasn't like I went on vacation. It was just like this is my new schedule, and it hurts me.

03:10:12
<transcript>: it hurts

03:10:15
uberrick: Hey Adam!

03:10:17
<transcript>: It hurts. Okay, so we've got this new width. We can set it to zero.

03:10:17
<transcript>: and there

03:10:19
tomofromearth___: @ohmymndy tomofrCRAZY

03:10:19
<transcript>: And there it is.

03:10:19
<transcript>: we can set

03:10:22
<transcript>: We can set it to.

03:10:22
<transcript>: one hundred

03:10:27
<transcript>: 100. Okay, so we need to calculate how far this thing needs to go.

03:10:27
<transcript>: if

03:10:30
<transcript>: If we do percentages, that would be easier. Right.

03:10:31
itsboek: I used to work in open source and stream the whole day so I feel ya

03:10:34
<transcript>: So if we did like 50%.

03:10:36
itsboek: Might try to do it again

03:10:38
<transcript>: Yeah. So we're gonna do percentages.

03:10:43
<transcript>: And they're going to be like this, right.

03:10:46
<transcript>: Oh.

03:10:46
<transcript>: no

03:10:48
<transcript>: No.

03:10:55
<transcript>: Okay. So this is going to be some variable.

03:10:58
<transcript>: Lapsed. I know.

03:11:02
<transcript>: Lapse percentage.

03:11:04
<transcript>: Let's create that.

03:11:09
<transcript>: Constellap.

03:11:15
<transcript>: That's all wrong. Yeah. There it is. Equals zero. Okay.

03:11:17
<transcript>: The Lapse percentage.

03:11:17
<transcript>: that's our

03:11:17
guillermorodas: @TomoFromEarth___ How do you managed to get the verifcation?

03:11:19
<transcript>: That's our width.

03:11:26
<transcript>: Now, if we increase that right. That's what we're looking for.

03:11:31
<transcript>: And we need to calculate it based on what based on I think result has the.

03:11:37
<transcript>: Result has the expired, but it also should have let's see.

03:11:42
<transcript>: Results dot.

03:11:48
<transcript>: Next now maybe it's not the result, is it the it's around.

03:11:48
<transcript>: yeah

03:11:48
davur_: should it be const?

03:11:52
<transcript>: Yeah. Expires. So this is a timestamp right here.

03:11:52
<transcript>: okay

03:11:54
<transcript>: Okay. So let's think about this.

03:11:57
<transcript>: Let's think about this.

03:12:02
tomofromearth___: @guillermorodas I used do a cooking show on twitch and I had a lot of viewers for that.  Averaged around 200-300 viewers for that, mostly old mars fans.

03:12:03
<transcript>: Elapsed percentage is going to be it's a ten second duration.

03:12:10
<transcript>: So we need the start time to calculate this. We need the start time. Right.

03:12:13
<transcript>: Do we have the start time round.

03:12:13
<transcript>: no

03:12:18
<transcript>: No. Okay. So we need to go back to the server.

03:12:20
<transcript>: Game.

03:12:21
iamreda: !playlist

03:12:24
<transcript>: Here.

03:12:24
<transcript>: so

03:12:25
jenswoeste: hey Adam - hope you are well. Id offer you a streaming studio at my office if youd like to join. I can pay in espresso and all the "bars" you can eat. You would have to relocate to LEGOLand though so dont know if that is feasible?

03:12:26
<transcript>: So we have expired.

03:12:30
<transcript>: This new date? Right here. Where's that new.

03:12:30
<transcript>: date

03:12:31
<transcript>: Date let's do.

03:12:35
<transcript>: Date.

03:12:41
<transcript>: Right. This is oh, this is answer. We need to do this in the Create round.

03:12:43
nate_codes: @TomoFromEarth___ plz stream more...you'd definitely get some viewers

03:12:45
<transcript>: 1st 2nd 3rd 4th.

03:12:50
caldotjs: starting to look nice! can't wait till I can actually actively follow the stream again :D

03:12:50
<transcript>: Okay. Here we go. Expires new date and we set the seconds.

03:12:53
<transcript>: So let's just do.

03:12:53
<transcript>: start

03:12:55
<transcript>: Start new date.

03:12:56
amazinglysk: what is that plugin or setting you use for this nice neovim layout ?

03:13:00
<transcript>: We create around. We set a start time for the round just like that.

03:13:00
<transcript>: i guess we

03:13:03
<transcript>: I guess we need to store that on the.

03:13:03
<transcript>: in the data

03:13:05
<transcript>: In the database too.

03:13:05
<transcript>: amazing

03:13:13
<transcript>: Amazingly SK. Welcome to Chat. What is the plugin or setting you use for this nice new Vin layout? My dot files have all of my new of them config.

03:13:13
<transcript>: so if

03:13:16
<transcript>: So if you go to GitHub.

03:13:16
adamdotdev: !dotfiles

03:13:16
fossabot: Adam's dotfiles live here: https://github.com/adamelmore/dotfiles

03:13:22
<transcript>: Or Dot files. Maybe Zack, Man. Yeah, if you check those out, that's all my neo of M. Config.

03:13:30
<transcript>: Starting to look nice. Can we tell you actually fold? Yeah, I can't wait till you can. Too calvat.

03:13:30
iamreda: !playlist

03:13:41
<transcript>: Yangs hope you're well, I am well, I'd offer you a stream suit at my office. If you'd like to join, I can pay an espresso all the bars you keep.

03:13:42
guillermorodas: @TomoFromEarth___ Interesting!

03:13:44
<transcript>: Have to relocate to Legoland, though.

03:13:51
<transcript>: I mean, Lego Land sounds amazing. Oh, yeah, that's right. Legos Basson, Denmark. That's the thing.

03:13:56
<transcript>: Did I say that right? Is it in Denmark.

03:13:56
<transcript>: i am

03:14:01
davur_: yep Denmark

03:14:02
jenswoeste: yeah - HQ is here in Billund Denmark

03:14:02
<transcript>: I am Rita. I don't have the playlist publishes a command, but it is on my Spotify publicly. If you want to check it out.

03:14:09
<transcript>: Rick is here. Hey, Rick, I'm just catching up on chat. Sorry.

03:14:12
<transcript>: You used to streamline.

03:14:12
<transcript>: and you kind of quit

03:14:13
<transcript>: And you kind of quit.

03:14:13
<transcript>: well

03:14:20
<transcript>: Well, once you start getting further along in your Web Dev career, start streaming. You know what? People are so happy.

03:14:20
<transcript>: when

03:14:33
<transcript>: When you're learning stuff like tech stuff on Twitch, I learned basically all of them from just streaming on Twitch. I knew nothing about them, and I just started streaming and trying to learn it. And everyone just tells you what to do. It's fantastic.

03:14:38
<transcript>: And you'd have people showing up. Tomo. You know, you start streaming.

03:14:38
<transcript>: it doesn't matter

03:14:43
jenswoeste: https://www.google.com/maps/uv?pb=!1s0x464b71e0c1db99e9%3A0xae059277bd561b!3m1!7e115!4shttps%3A%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipPhLs9z4wBfe73cPFWmEUKja_cb5JaGeN7UfSA7%3Dw281-h160-k-no!5slego%20campus%20-%20Google%20Search!15sCgIgAQ&imagekey=!1e10!2sAF1QipPhLs9z4wBfe73cPFWmEUKja_cb5JaGeN7UfSA7&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiIzJq5xKP6AhWJ7qQKHQ1jAUcQoip6BQiXARAD

03:14:46
<transcript>: It doesn't matter how early you are in your coding career, people will be there and they will be super helpful. I promise you.

03:14:48
<transcript>: I.

03:14:50
davur_: got my first driver's licence driving a lego car in LegoLand... good times

03:14:51
<transcript>: So Rick is here.

03:14:58
<transcript>: Should something be a constant? I miss that dabber? What should be a constant? Uhoh.

03:14:58
<transcript>: something

03:15:00
<transcript>: Something should have been a comp.

03:15:03
<transcript>: complicated

03:15:05
<transcript>: Complicated show, that's so cool.

03:15:16
<transcript>: So Yen's, I'll get back to you rain check I'll get back to you on the fulltime offer there all bars I can eat I have to make to Denmark I think.

03:15:19
<transcript>: And.

03:15:20
davur_: (was asking if elapsedTime is supposed to be a const)

03:15:21
daeeyy: Is Denmark and Netherlands the same thing?

03:15:23
<transcript>: Yep. Okay.

03:15:23
<transcript>: billand

03:15:28
tomofromearth___: I’ll stream again when I’m further along, right now I am fully focused on learning.

03:15:30
<transcript>: The YouTube paste. It a very large Google.

03:15:30
<transcript>: query

03:15:33
<transcript>: Query, what is that? Yen's.

03:15:37
jenswoeste: yeah dosnt work

03:15:39
<transcript>: Got your first driver's license during a Lego car. And Legoland, that's amazing.

03:15:41
jenswoeste: its the lego campus

03:15:45
<transcript>: Oh, is the last time Socio concert? Oh, yeah, no, I guess it won't be it's not even gonna be.

03:15:45
<transcript>: like

03:15:46
<transcript>: Like.

03:15:48
ohmymndy: Just started playing Lego Legacy on my phone, it is super fun

03:15:50
stroopwafel26: @daeeyy lol no

03:15:51
<transcript>: A set set state or a use state hook thing.

03:15:53
<transcript>: Okay.

03:15:53
<transcript>: day you

03:15:59
<transcript>: Day you asked the question that I had in my head is Denmark and Netherlands. The same thing I had that same exact question.

03:16:03
<transcript>: Doesn't work. It's the Lego campus.

03:16:03
<transcript>: who answered that

03:16:06
<transcript>: Who answered that question? They're not the same thing. Okay, thank you.

03:16:06
<transcript>: lol

03:16:08
<transcript>: Lol or not.

03:16:08
<transcript>: not just

03:16:08
turklerburada: ofc it is not LUL

03:16:10
<transcript>: Not just no, but lol now.

03:16:10
<transcript>: why did i think

03:16:15
stroopwafel26: Doesn't America teach geography in school?

03:16:20
<transcript>: Why did I think that, too? I also had the same question when I was questioning Denmark earlier. It was because I was thinking, Wait, is Denmark a city in the Netherlands, or vice versa.

03:16:28
laytanl_: Loll how do you think that

03:16:33
stroopwafel26: clearly

03:16:33
<transcript>: Not very well. Clearly, someone. Yeah. Apparently, America education system has confused. This. Is that a fellow American that also thought that.

03:16:33
iamreda: clever

03:16:34
jenswoeste: Denmark is the capital of Ikea

03:16:34
nate_codes: @TomoFromEarth___ I'm trying to do some pair coding streams....would you be interested in co-learning on someone else's stream? :)

03:16:38
<transcript>: How do you think that okay, calm down, everybody.

03:16:38
<transcript>: like

03:16:42
<transcript>: Like, just go easy on me. I'm an American. I live in the Midwestern, United States.

03:16:42
<transcript>: i don't know

03:16:47
<transcript>: I don't know a lot. There's a lot of things I don't know. Denmark is the capital of Ikea.

03:16:52
<transcript>: That's just funny.

03:16:53
<transcript>: Let's.

03:16:55
<transcript>: Go.

03:16:55
<transcript>: try and do

03:17:01
<transcript>: Try and do some pair coding streams. Would you be interested in Colarning? Oh, you're talking to Tomo.

03:17:05
<transcript>: Okay. Let's let's see here.

03:17:05
<transcript>: we're doing something

03:17:06
nate_codes: @adamdotdev I already asked you to collab

03:17:07
turklerburada: we only know american language and american history KKona

03:17:11
<transcript>: We're doing something with start. So we have a start and it expires. We're gonna expose it in the schema.

03:17:11
<transcript>: let's go to

03:17:14
<transcript>: Let's go to Oh.

03:17:14
<transcript>: schema

03:17:15
<transcript>: Schema.

03:17:16
stroopwafel26: IKEA is Swedish but its HQ is actually registered in The Netherlands for tax reasons, sleazy eh

03:17:21
nate_codes: @adamdotdev I'm counting on you for that sweet sweet DDB education

03:17:24
<transcript>: And let's see. Look at that. I'm using pages down. Everybody. I learned I learned a thing.

03:17:28
<transcript>: Game score. Okay. So the round has a stark and it expires.

03:17:28
<transcript>: that's the thing

03:17:31
<transcript>: That's the thing. We changed here, right.

03:17:33
<transcript>: Okay.

03:17:33
<transcript>: start

03:17:35
<transcript>: Start expires.

03:17:37
<transcript>: Okay.

03:17:42
<transcript>: So then going back here, I'm gonna have to do so many things now. I have to do this. I have to go.

03:17:46
<transcript>: Here. I have to generate so.

03:17:49
dendenguy: page down is so far away tho :(

03:17:50
<transcript>: What am I doing.

03:17:50
<transcript>: rio

03:17:50
ohmymndy: I really like the veggie (or are the vegan?) balls from ikea

03:17:56
<transcript>: Rio MPX Prisma generate right. I have to do that. And then I have to DB push. I think.

03:17:56
<transcript>: is the

03:18:00
<transcript>: Is the DB push? Yeah.

03:18:03
<transcript>: Page down is still so far away.

03:18:03
<transcript>: yeah

03:18:05
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:18:06
iamreda: can someone explain to me the beta key on public.dev ?

03:18:10
<transcript>: You can on me for some DynamoDB education. Nate I will definitely do some.

03:18:13
ohmymndy: !publicdev

03:18:19
ohmymndy: !publicdotdev

03:18:22
<transcript>: Nate. I will definitely collab with you. I would love to. Is it Colab or collab? I guess the word is collaboration. So collab. I will collab with you.

03:18:22
<transcript>: i will definitely

03:18:32
<transcript>: I will definitely do that. That sounds fun if you only know American language in American history. Yeah. Like, I hate that. I don't know. The Metric system. For instance, I would.

03:18:38
<transcript>: Wish my kids did, but we still just use the American thing.

03:18:48
cowfacedude99: the metric system is pretty nice for conversions.

03:18:49
<transcript>: Really like the Veggie? Or are the Vegan ball? Yeah, they're Vegan. They are for Mykea. That's right. I know that much about the world.

03:18:50
stroopwafel26: that's why I always convert to freedom units for you @adamdotdev

03:18:54
turklerburada: metric system is so easy tbh

03:18:55
trout_soda: I had to convert celsius to Fahrenheit in my head this morning

03:18:55
nate_codes: metric system is definitely the best...12 inches to a foot...5280 in a mile?? FUCK OFF!

03:18:56
adamdotdev: !betakey

03:18:56
fossabot: Use beta key `adamisontwitch2` after signing up at public.dev.

03:18:57
<transcript>: Can explain to me the beta key on public Dev. Yeah, if you do a beta key, it's beta key, I think.

03:19:00
<transcript>: Basically like that. You'll get the beta key. You can just use that.

03:19:04
<transcript>: Freedom Unit for me.

03:19:12
<transcript>: Cafe Cow Face how Kathy is, how do you just hop in with that comment and not introduce or not say, like, Hi.

03:19:12
<transcript>: i miss you

03:19:23
<transcript>: I miss you, Calface. Sorry that came off like hostel. An issue, that's all. Then you just be popped in with that little comment. Who knew you were here? I didn't know you were here.

03:19:30
<transcript>: To convert. Yeah, metric system probably is so easy if you grew up using the metric system.

03:19:30
<transcript>: that's

03:19:38
<transcript>: That's why I hate the Americans. It's like kids could learn it so easy. I can't teach my kids because I don't know it. But I know it's so much better. Like.

03:19:38
<transcript>: someone

03:19:53
<transcript>: Someone one of my teachers in school talks about how you can ask, like any kid in Europe, how many cubic centimeters in a liter? Because it's like a thousand or something. It's some normal number. But in America, it's like how many cubic inches are in a gallon.

03:19:59
<transcript>: I don't know. Nobody knows. Because it's some weird number. I hate it.

03:20:04
<transcript>: Yeah. Exactly. Nate. The twelve inches to a foot.

03:20:04
<transcript>: this is just the whole

03:20:06
<transcript>: This is just the whole thing. It's so bad.

03:20:17
stroopwafel26: How many cubic inches in a gallon? Probably something to do with football fields

03:20:20
<transcript>: Calculate Celsius to Fahrenheit in your head. Yeah, I know. I never can remember. I know. It's like super simple to know how to do that. And I just don't know. So apply this change. We need to reset the database. Yes, that's fine. Okay.

03:20:24
<transcript>: So I'm all have to do I'm after restart the server I think.

03:20:27
<transcript>: Yeah, there we go.

03:20:29
<transcript>: All right.

03:20:32
cowfacedude99: I opened twitch now. I was learning for my gcp exam.

03:20:36
turklerburada: @stroopwafel26 at least 2 football fields

03:20:38
<transcript>: So now we have the start thing. Did not even write that yet. Okay, let's go back here. We're gonna set start here.

03:20:43
<transcript>: Right here. Even.

03:20:46
<transcript>: No. Can I not do that.

03:20:49
<transcript>: What is it saying.

03:20:56
<transcript>: This is around. Right? Let's just LSP restart.

03:20:56
<transcript>: how about that's it

03:20:57
<transcript>: How about that's? It.

03:21:02
<transcript>: Lsp restart right.

03:21:06
<transcript>: Okay.

03:21:14
<transcript>: So that's around now we're having okay so a start time. So if I go to index.

03:21:17
<transcript>: A laptop. Okay, so now the round.

03:21:23
<transcript>: Start equals roundup start. Yeah. Okay.

03:21:28
<transcript>: Let's do this.

03:21:34
<transcript>: If I wanted to surround this, I'm still not used to that, is it.

03:21:38
<transcript>: Yf no.

03:21:46
<transcript>: Nope. Definitely not that.

03:21:46
<transcript>: i just want to

03:21:50
cyberimmersion: ysiw"

03:21:51
<transcript>: I just want to use surveillance. I want to use inventoround so bad. And I can't remember how to do it.

03:21:54
<transcript>: Do it that way.

03:21:54
<transcript>: fire

03:22:01
laytanl_: ysaw{

03:22:04
cyberimmersion: to surround with  "

03:22:07
<transcript>: Fires are expired. Okay, so Elast percentage is going to be if we know the start time and we know the expire time and we know the current time, we can figure out the percentage right.

03:22:10
cyberimmersion: i don't know what you want to surround it with

03:22:11
<transcript>: So the current time of the problem with this is.

03:22:17
<transcript>: It's got to be in a hook or something. We don't want the current time.

03:22:21
<transcript>: Yeah. We got to have, like.

03:22:23
<transcript>: Use effect.

03:22:25
<transcript>: Right.

03:22:30
<transcript>: That's going to set a timer.

03:22:38
<transcript>: Or set an interval. Okay, let's see Const interval handle.

03:22:38
<transcript>: let's do a handle

03:22:39
<transcript>: Let's do a handle.

03:22:43
<transcript>: Equals.

03:22:46
<transcript>: That interval.

03:22:54
<transcript>: And that's going to be like, every, I don't know, hundred miles.

03:22:54
<transcript>: sure

03:22:55
<transcript>: Sure.

03:22:55
<transcript>: so

03:22:57
<transcript>: So this is going to.

03:23:01
<transcript>: Do something. What are we gonna do? We're gonna recalculate.

03:23:05
<transcript>: The Elapsed percentage so we need to have.

03:23:07
<transcript>: Laps.

03:23:11
<transcript>: Set elapsed.

03:23:16
<transcript>: Equals react use state.

03:23:20
<transcript>: It's going to be a what a number.

03:23:25
<transcript>: What's wrong with this? Oh users that can't find use back.

03:23:29
<transcript>: So we have a lapse. Don't need that anymore.

03:23:29
<transcript>: it

03:23:31
<transcript>: It's just gonna be.

03:23:34
<transcript>: Page down, come on.

03:23:42
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow Asim.

03:23:42
<transcript>: i appreciate it

03:23:47
<transcript>: I appreciate it. Oh, late night coming through Ysa W why is that so hard for me to remember.

03:23:47
<transcript>: ys

03:23:56
<transcript>: Ysi, W or Ysaw. So I've got to go around the word that should be so intuitive. And it's not. It's like the two characters.

03:23:56
<transcript>: for

03:23:58
<transcript>: For the like the intro.

03:23:58
<transcript>: to create an

03:24:03
<transcript>: To create an new surround is just too much for me. My brain can't hold two characters there for some reason.

03:24:09
<transcript>: I think you can just go and do a football field. Probably.

03:24:13
<transcript>: You just open twist, cow face. I.

03:24:13
<transcript>: forgive you

03:24:15
<transcript>: Forgive you.

03:24:15
<transcript>: i'm just

03:24:23
<transcript>: I'm just playing learning for your GCP exam. Google Cloud you taking some Google Cloud Certs cafes. That's cool.

03:24:24
itsboek: lol I love the "it should be so intuitive" phase of vim 😂

03:24:30
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat Cyber. I appreciate you coming in with the Surround tip.

03:24:30
<transcript>: just welcoming yourself

03:24:34
<transcript>: Just welcoming yourself into chat with some helpfulness I appreciate it a whole lot.

03:24:39
<transcript>: Don't yeah, I want to surround with the brackets.

03:24:44
laytanl_: You also got cs{( to change the { to (.

03:24:44
<transcript>: Yeah, it should be so should be so intuitive it's not but it should be.

03:24:50
<transcript>: Okay, so we set this up at the beginning of the Ram when it's rendered.

03:24:50
<transcript>: see

03:24:52
<transcript>: See.

03:24:55
<transcript>: The handle. What are we gonna do? We're gonna set a lap.

03:25:00
stroopwafel26: I should be learning for my AWS SA pro certificate, renewing it for the nth time ugh

03:25:03
<transcript>: Set. Elapsed, is this a bad idea? Am I gonna get some kind of a loop.

03:25:07
<transcript>: Elapse is going to be okay. So it's the current time.

03:25:11
<transcript>: Current equals New Date right.

03:25:11
<transcript>: so

03:25:14
<transcript>: So it's no J there it's current.

03:25:15
laytanl_: or ds{ to delete

03:25:16
<transcript>: Minus.

03:25:19
<transcript>: Current no.

03:25:25
<transcript>: So we need the denimator is like expires minus start.

03:25:25
<transcript>: which i can

03:25:27
<transcript>: Which I can calculate up here, right.

03:25:38
<transcript>: Oh, I can't do that. Can I do math with dates.

03:25:40
<transcript>: If I turn them into numbers.

03:25:42
<transcript>: Yeah, I guess so.

03:25:45
<transcript>: Dot, can you not do that.

03:25:49
<transcript>: Can I not do that.

03:25:56
<transcript>: I value in milliseconds.

03:26:01
<transcript>: This what I should do. People. Someone tell me.

03:26:04
<transcript>: That link would be.

03:26:07
<transcript>: A number.

03:26:07
<transcript>: and then

03:26:10
<transcript>: And then elapse.

03:26:10
<transcript>: elapse

03:26:12
<transcript>: Elapsed.

03:26:12
<transcript>: would be

03:26:13
<transcript>: Would be.

03:26:15
<transcript>: Current.

03:26:21
<transcript>: Currently start.

03:26:28
<transcript>: Right current minus star.

03:26:30
cowfacedude99: my workplace is paying to get people certified. so I hopped in on the wagon LUL

03:26:33
<transcript>: Except you can't do date mass like that. I thought you could just do date masks.

03:26:33
jenswoeste: so Adam - do you know of any resource to assist in hardware sizing a mysql database? I need to provision it on Azure but find it hard to choose a hardware profile.

03:26:36
laytanl_: At the beginning I just kept https://github.com/kylechui/nvim-surround#rocket-usage open until I got it

03:26:41
<transcript>: You also got CS to change the yeah, Yeah.

03:26:41
<transcript>: thank you la

03:26:46
<transcript>: Thank you. Laden. Should be learning for my AWS SA pro.

03:26:46
<transcript>: renewing it for

03:26:53
<transcript>: Renewing it for the Int time. Ooh. Ooh. I've still got like, two years online. I'm gonna keep riding that working.

03:26:57
<transcript>: To get people certified oh, nice.

03:27:02
<transcript>: Yin's do you have do you know the resource to assist in hardware sizing.

03:27:02
<transcript>: a mysql database

03:27:07
<transcript>: A MySQL database need to provision it on Azure, but find it hard to choose hardware. Voila I don't.

03:27:07
<transcript>: i don't

03:27:11
<transcript>: I don't anyone in Chat no of a good resource for that.

03:27:16
cyberimmersion: also if you do ysaw{   with the left curly, it will put a space on before the content inside, if you do ysaw} withe the right one it will do no space

03:27:16
<transcript>: 's a good idea, Leighton. I'm gonna copy that right now.

03:27:21
<transcript>: Copy that. Right here.

03:27:30
<transcript>: Okay. Why do I have to actually convert these to numbers? Because if I do, then I could just do.

03:27:32
<transcript>: Date now.

03:27:38
<transcript>: And then start would be. I could just store these in time or in numbers.

03:27:51
<transcript>: I don't know. So I don't have an answer for that. Is there something else I can help with? Who is that? Oh, that's, Siri. I thought it was Google, and I couldn't figure out what's so loud is my watch that's freed me.

03:27:51
<transcript>: did you guys hear that

03:27:53
<transcript>: Did you guys hear that.

03:27:53
<transcript>: i mean surely

03:27:56
<transcript>: I mean, surely you heard it. My mic picks up everything in this office.

03:28:02
turklerburada: it freaked me out too LUL

03:28:07
<transcript>: If we say that's a lap, we need to multiply it by.

03:28:07
<transcript>: the

03:28:10
<transcript>: The length right or something.

03:28:12
<transcript>: So if links.

03:28:12
<transcript>: were like ten

03:28:14
<transcript>: Were like 10 seconds.

03:28:14
<transcript>: that's

03:28:15
<transcript>: That's.

03:28:15
<transcript>: ten

03:28:18
<transcript>: 10,000 milliseconds.

03:28:20
<transcript>: Okay.

03:28:20
<transcript>: if ten

03:28:24
icedcoffefe: the way u turned around lmao

03:28:25
ohmymndy: I like some background music, but for me it is a bit much with vocals...

03:28:27
laytanl_: Siri took some steroids

03:28:37
<transcript>: If 100 milliseconds is the whole length and we've gone current minus start. So we've gone. Let's say a thousand milliseconds 1 second. Then we are one over. Okay, so it's the elapse over the total length. So divided by right.

03:28:44
stroopwafel26: @OhMyMndy LoFi girl ftw

03:28:46
<transcript>: Length that's elapsed as a percentage, right. I might need to clean that up in some way. We're missing links.

03:28:46
<transcript>: i guess

03:28:50
<transcript>: I guess if length changes. Thank you so much for the follow. Milk Hunter.

03:28:57
turklerburada: haha

03:29:00
<transcript>: Oh, is the music bothering you? Mandy? Is that what I'm hearing.

03:29:00
<transcript>: is my music

03:29:01
cyberimmersion: kappa

03:29:02
<transcript>: Is my music too loud.

03:29:02
<transcript>: or was it

03:29:04
<transcript>: Or was it, sir? That was too laugh.

03:29:12
<transcript>: A loafi girl. I can play low fiber. Oh, what is that? Is that is that like, on.

03:29:12
<transcript>: is that

03:29:13
<transcript>: Is that on.

03:29:13
<transcript>: this

03:29:14
ohmymndy: No, just that there are vocals

03:29:15
trout_soda: probably Math.floor eventually. might get wild decimals

03:29:15
<transcript>: This thing.

03:29:20
<transcript>: Loaf. I girl. I searched lofi. Girl? Is that on here.

03:29:22
stroopwafel26: it's on spotify and youtube yeah

03:29:24
<transcript>: Let's do it.

03:29:24
<transcript>: is that what you're talking

03:29:26
<transcript>: Is that what you're talking about.

03:29:26
<transcript>: public

03:29:28
<transcript>: Public playlists.

03:29:29
milfhunter433: does nextauth falls under t3?

03:29:36
<transcript>: Some Spotify. Youtube. Okay, well, we'll do it. Let's do it.

03:29:38
<transcript>: Is this the right one.

03:29:38
<transcript>: here we go

03:29:39
nexxeln: it does @milfhunter433

03:29:40
stroopwafel26: yes this one

03:29:42
nexxeln: helllo adam

03:29:52
<transcript>: Here we go. No lyrics for you. I actually I have this weird thing where I don't hear lyrics and music. Like, I just don't pay attention to them. So I listen to some stuff. And my wife is like, if you listen to what they're saying, like, no, actually, I haven't I just hear sound.

03:29:52
<transcript>: i don't know

03:29:53
<transcript>: I don't know what that's about.

03:29:59
<transcript>: Does next month fall under T three. Yes.

03:30:09
<transcript>: I'm using next off in T three which is like an option. I think you can choose not to maybe but math floor eventually might get wild decimals. Let's get call.

03:30:11
<transcript>: That's a good call.

03:30:11
<transcript>: let's

03:30:14
<transcript>: Let's do it. Hey, next one. It's.

03:30:14
<transcript>: next

03:30:16
<transcript>: Next is here.

03:30:16
<transcript>: so matt

03:30:19
<transcript>: So Matt floor on this whole thing.

03:30:22
<transcript>: So let's go.

03:30:23
<transcript>: F.

03:30:26
nate_codes: @nexxeln t3ggWave t3ggWave t3ggWave t3ggWave t3ggWave

03:30:27
<transcript>: And then math.

03:30:27
<transcript>: floor

03:30:30
<transcript>: Floor I have to like have to verbalize.

03:30:32
nexxeln: ayo nate_codes

03:30:34
<transcript>: At the verbalize my Vin usage sometimes you know.

03:30:39
<transcript>: So it's saying I need to pass length in here. And I see why it's saying that.

03:30:42
<transcript>: Because links can change.

03:30:42
<transcript>: so link

03:30:46
<transcript>: So link that's going to change with the round. I think I just need to say when the round changes.

03:30:53
<transcript>: I'm just going to calculate all this stuff. So let's let's do this.

03:31:01
<transcript>: Like that. Let's put them both down here.

03:31:09
<transcript>: Now that should be good now just need to return.

03:31:13
<transcript>: Clear interval.

03:31:16
<transcript>: Handle okay.

03:31:20
<transcript>: Thanks so much for the Follow C. Brito.

03:31:20

nexxeln: too early adam to make that joke LUL

03:32:02
itsboek: All* wow this is why I can't watch streams this early in the morning

03:32:05
<transcript>: It should be based on the start and the end time of the round. Let's see. Do we have a ten second timer going? Let's try it.

03:32:06
tomofromearth___: tomofrBabyTomo

03:32:12
<transcript>: 's not ideal.

03:32:12
<transcript>: what do we

03:32:14
<transcript>: What do we think? I'm.

03:32:18
cowfacedude99: I listen to kpop mainly because I tend to pay attention to lyrics. And since I don't know what they are saying ( and I don't bother to watch the lyric videos) they form a pretty good background music

03:32:25
nate_codes: @TomoFromEarth___ can confirm...now friends....

03:32:25
<transcript>: Toma will be everyone's friend.

03:32:25
<transcript>: first i

03:32:40
<transcript>: First I'm chat. Welcome to Chat. Santa is the Levera Santa. Or Santor is Aloe Vera. Maybe. Did I get that right? Having to code a function name for I'm not saying for this much longer, why would you have to do that.

03:32:44
<transcript>: Whoever's making you do that. Maybe just tell them you'd rather not.

03:32:52
<transcript>: Too early to make that joke? What joke did I make? Did I make a joke? Oh, yeah, yeah, no, too soon I gotcha yeah, the Jordan joke is too early.

03:32:57
ohmymndy: What a bunch of friendly people in here, I love it

03:33:07
iamreda: yeah so friendly

03:33:07
<transcript>: Listen the Kpop mainly because I tend to pay attention to lyrics since I don't know what they are saying and I don't bother to watch the lyric videos. They form a pretty good bankrupt that makes sense.

03:33:09
<transcript>: That makes sense.

03:33:12
<transcript>: Okay so friendly.

03:33:12
<transcript>: everyone's so friendly

03:33:13
<transcript>: Everyone's so friendly.

cyberimmersion: thats funny, i just learned about theo yesterday in a random youtube video, and today i see you and learn about t3 and now i want to learn typescript and next.js

2dorkstv: you get the audience you deserve :)

03:33:32
<transcript>: Because the mean people just they come in and they're like, this guy can't handle it. He would not be able to handle my trolling. And I mean, this. We've had a couple people troll me. Well, it was you people. You all trolled me about something. And I believed you. I believed everywhere to it. What was it.

03:33:32
<transcript>: something

03:33:33
<transcript>: Something.

03:33:33
<transcript>: you

03:33:35
finitesingularity: The software dev category in particular is AWESOME..

03:33:37
<transcript>: You told me that audio is doubling. And I believe.

03:33:41
stroopwafel26: I remember the trolling about the double sound

03:33:42
turklerburada: a lot of drama going on right now LUL it is not friendly at all

03:33:44
stroopwafel26: good times

03:33:44
<transcript>: Forever trying to fix it. So what is this? Why do we have this infinitely long? Is a percentage not working.

03:33:44
<transcript>: let's

03:33:47
<transcript>: Let's do this. Let's log.

03:33:51
<transcript>: See how large.

03:33:51
<transcript>: the bar is now

03:33:52
<transcript>: The bar is now.

03:33:55
<transcript>: Elapsed. Oh, that's a big number.

03:33:58
<transcript>: So that is more than 100.

03:33:58
<transcript>: which would

03:34:01
<transcript>: Which would mean the percent. Okay. So my math is wrong.

03:34:01
<transcript>: very very wrong

03:34:02
iamreda: @FiniteSingularity yeah not like gaming,

03:34:02
<transcript>: Very, very wrong.

03:34:02
<transcript>: let's do this

03:34:04
<transcript>: Let's do this.

03:34:07
<transcript>: Let's do.

03:34:07
<transcript>: this

03:34:08
<transcript>: This.

03:34:09
laytanl_: I was convinced the audio was actually double

03:34:14
cowfacedude99: Do you have a regex license? @adamdotdev

03:34:17
<transcript>: To save the computer from having to compute that very large width. And they'll figure out what I did wrong.

03:34:18
laytanl_: Wasn't even trolling

03:34:21
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:34:24
<transcript>: Here, let's log some things.

03:34:29
<transcript>: Let's say.

03:34:30
finitesingularity: @FiniteSingularity I have no idea..  I stay away, as It sounds like the bad place.. LUL

03:34:32
<transcript>: Start.

03:34:34
<transcript>: Art.

03:34:37
<transcript>: Expires.

03:34:48
<transcript>: I guess I could have just done links.

03:34:49
<transcript>: Current.

03:34:56
<transcript>: And let's do links to.

03:35:03
<transcript>: This is the one time I missed copilot. Copilot would have just written that whole thing for me. Oh, look at all that.

03:35:07
<transcript>: Okay, so start is a time.

03:35:07
<transcript>: expires

03:35:10
<transcript>: Expires as a time current is a number.

03:35:15
<transcript>: And Links is much smaller. Number.

03:35:18
<transcript>: Why is links such a small number.

03:35:26
<transcript>: Does it need to be multiply by thousand or something? Why is current so big? What's current date? Dot now.

03:35:31
cowfacedude99: why do you use current and start and expires?

03:35:38
<transcript>: Late. And you were actually convinced it was doubling. That's funny. Stroop knew it wasn't. That's why he said good times.

03:35:45
sergioquijano: I think there's a plugin for using autopilot in nvim. Prob you already know but just in case

03:35:46
<transcript>: Software in Dev category. Particularly. It's awesome. It is awesome.

03:35:46
<transcript>: much

03:35:54
<transcript>: Much of kind people. I don't find Twitter to be as kind. From being honest, I'm gonna do my Twitter, my Twitter thing, right? I rant against Twitter.

03:35:59
<transcript>: This I just learned about the ocean. Random YouTube video. And today I see you in the.

03:35:59
<transcript>: t three

03:36:01
<transcript>: T three. Look at you.

03:36:01
<transcript>: you're just hitting

03:36:03
<transcript>: You're just hitting all the.

03:36:03
<transcript>: landmarks

03:36:05
<transcript>: Landmarks. Co. T, three.

03:36:07
stroopwafel26: @laytanl_ I always listen to the stream using my AIrPods Max so I pick up these things maybe :P

03:36:09
<transcript>: Yeah. So Twitter if you're new to development like Tomo.

03:36:09
<transcript>: twitter

03:36:12
<transcript>: Twitter can be dangerous. Okay.

03:36:12
<transcript>: twitter

03:36:14
<transcript>: Twitter is.

03:36:14
<transcript>: kind of

03:36:16
<transcript>: Kind of a cesspool of.

03:36:16
<transcript>: nonsense

03:36:20
<transcript>: Nonsense. I hate I really I can't stand Twitter lately.

03:36:25
<transcript>: There's just so much like fake thought leadership and so much.

03:36:25
<transcript>: people

03:36:30
<transcript>: People not with good intentions like they want to grow their account on Twitter.

03:36:30
<transcript>: so they

03:36:41
trout_soda: the grift

03:36:43
<transcript>: So they know the stuff you got opposed to grow on Twitter, and it's just not helpful. And my problem with it is I can ignore it. I've been a software Dev for 15 years. Like, I have enough context to be like.

03:36:43
<transcript>: that list

03:36:52
tomofromearth___: Don’t follow me on Twitter if you’re easily offended hahaha.

03:36:55
<transcript>: That list of Ten things. The Grift. Yes, exactly. Crowd that list of Ten things is garbage. And it's not helpful. And it's gonna lead people astray I can see that know that. But the problem is people who are new don't have that context.

03:36:58
<transcript>: And that's a problem.

03:36:58
<transcript>: don't fall on twitter

03:37:15
<transcript>: Don't fall on Twitter. Freeze with them. No, that kind of Twitter is fine. I love people speaking their mind on Twitter. I don't love the people who post fake listicles. They're like, if you want to be a cloud developer, learn these ten things. And I hate that stuff. Hate it so much.

03:37:15
<transcript>: so so much

03:37:17
<transcript>: So so much because it does damage.

03:37:17
<transcript>: and there

03:37:37
<transcript>: And there are a lot of new developers who don't know better. And they see that list. And they might go off for weeks and spend time trying to learn those things because somebody on Twitter who is trying to grow their Twitter account, said that and try crazy. So how do we fix it, people? How do we how do we rid the world of Grift? I don't know, but I want to thank.

03:37:37
<transcript>: you so much for the follow

03:37:39
<transcript>: You so much for the follow. Brandy.

03:37:44
dnbull: Call out those people...

03:37:44
<transcript>: Like I want to say, hey, new developers on Twitter, maybe hang out on Twitter.

03:37:44
<transcript>: because on

03:37:46
<transcript>: Because on Twitch.

03:37:49
<transcript>: You can't do that. You can't like grit.

03:37:49
<transcript>: right

03:37:54
stroopwafel26: Get rid of the algo first

03:37:54
<transcript>: Right you can't make I can't I couldn't get on here and stream and be like.

03:37:54
<transcript>: just reading

03:37:58
cyberimmersion: so grift is like... fake helping?

03:38:00
tomofromearth___: Dude, even as a beginner I know there’s no such thing as “from zero code to 6 figures in 6 months…” 🙄

03:38:01
trout_soda: probably a better reputation system instead of a click-driven algo

03:38:01
<transcript>: Just reading some of the things people post as threads on Twitter. You would not come. You would leave.

03:38:06
turklerburada: 3 things you should learn to be a better programmer

03:38:20
dnbull: "I HaVE 100K FoLLoWeRS HeReS WhAT i DiD So YoU CaN TrY"

03:38:21
<transcript>: It's like fake helping. Yeah. It's just like it's unhelpful content that gets shared for some reason. That's part of the problem on Twitter. For some reason, that stuff does really well. People can make a thread that's really not helpful, and it can get thousands and thousands of retweets and likes. And I sound like I'm bitter. I'm not. I gave up on caring about Twitter a long time ago.

03:38:21
<transcript>: and i

03:38:22
finitesingularity: #Adam-For-TED-Talks :D

03:38:29
<transcript>: And I realized I could play the game and I could do the thing to have a bunch of followers on Twitter. But it's dumb. It's so dumb. And it's not helpful.

03:38:29
<transcript>: so calling

03:38:35
creativenull: It's easier to scratch the surface than it it to go in depth

03:38:37
stream_kyle: I remember a guy on YouTube got pretty big, and it turned out he didn't actually know anything, he was stealing his stuff from other people and just recreating it in streams/videos.

03:38:38
<transcript>: So calling out, is that the thing we got to just call people out for grifting. I block them. I block people that just bother me like that. That doesn't really help the people who don't know better.

03:38:38
<transcript>: so

03:38:43
<transcript>: So yeah, I got a call them out, just get very vocal. I'm just not a very confrontational person.

03:38:46
<transcript>: It's not in me to be like.

03:38:46
<transcript>: confront

03:38:51
<transcript>: Confronting people. But I guess on Twitter maybe I'm mad enough that I would do it. Maybe.

03:38:57
cyberimmersion: make a bot that calls out grifters! o.o

03:39:02
<transcript>: See, even Tomo knows from zero to coat. Yeah. Zero code to six figures in six months. Yeah, it's that kind of stuff. That stuff bothered me so much. Maybe it's not as big a problem, though. It's like Tomo, you're saying.

03:39:02
<transcript>: that

03:39:02
cowfacedude99: imo get people to follow the right people LUL

03:39:03
trout_soda: I think it has to be a systemic change on Twitter's side.

03:39:03
dnbull: Monday mornings are the worst...... those threads show up heavily on Monday from scheduled tweets

03:39:05
<transcript>: That you you know better.

03:39:05
<transcript>: i don't know

03:39:05
nexxeln: twitter kinda forces you to do that

03:39:13
<transcript>: I don't know. I get to send some people to maybe don't know better. That's why that content gets so many likes whoever's liking and retweeting it must think it's good.

03:39:14
iamreda: what's wrong with the audio ?

03:39:19
<transcript>: I don't know who those people are, but I hope to to educate them.

03:39:19
<transcript>: better

03:39:22
<transcript>: Better reputation system instead of a click driven Now Go, Yeah.

03:39:22
<transcript>: something

03:39:23
<transcript>: Something.

03:39:23
<transcript>: something right

03:39:27
<transcript>: Something right? Three things. You should learn to be a better programmer.

03:39:31
<transcript>: Yeah. And there are people.

03:39:31
<transcript>: being bull

03:39:35
brandymedia: Hey Adam. I don't even use TS but loving the stream.  Connected with you Twitter BTW.

03:39:36
<transcript>: Being Bull. There are people with a hundred thousand followers that do exactly what I'm talking about.

03:39:38
tomofromearth___: I know better but I’m 43 and have lived in the world.  If I was 22 I’d be like awesome how easy hahaba.

03:39:38
<transcript>: And.

03:39:45
<transcript>: Drives me up the wall because people that's another thing people see, like a big follower count. And they think this person knows what they're talking about.

03:39:45
<transcript>: a lot of people

03:39:46
nate_codes: @adamdotdev it's scam practice applied to tech education industry...really stinks to see it. There was a codeschool that had huge legal issues because they were making up fake success stories and stuff

03:39:53
nate_codes: "This 13 year old got a job at google" and they literally made him up

03:39:55
laytanl_: these threads are just a pyramid scheme of people retweeting each other

03:40:01
<transcript>: A lot of people follow them. A lot of people like and retweet what they say. They must know what they don't. They don't know what they're talking about or they do. And they just choose not to because that's not the stuff that does. Well, maybe they do know better. And that's even worse. They're intentionally leading people astray Adam for Ted talks. I don't know about that.

03:40:01
<transcript>: it's easier

03:40:01
dnbull: And those influencers only respond to other influencers and not to people who may legitimately have a question.

03:40:08
<transcript>: It's easier to scratch the service than it is to go in depth. Yeah, it is something about our monkey brains, but like we resonate with.

03:40:08
<transcript>: lists

03:40:14
ohmymndy: I really like one of Theo's latest video about those scam starter kits for 400 bucks

03:40:16
<transcript>: Lists. And very quick. Like it's the sugar, you know, not the nutrition. I don't know. I don't know how to fix that.

03:40:22
<transcript>: Hey, Kyle, Kyle's, here.

03:40:29
barneyoftherubble: Hey Adam how are you?

03:40:29
<transcript>: 's Someone from YouTube. I believe it. I believe that that could happen, that you could, like, create a whole YouTube channel, just faking it.

03:40:35
<transcript>: It'd be harder on YouTube than on Twitter, though.

03:40:35
<transcript>: it's really

03:40:43
<transcript>: It's really easy to fix stuff on Twitter because you just have to write 280 characters or like a thread of them and you can make stuff up all day.

03:40:45
nate_codes: @OhMyMndy I really liked that video as well..unfortunately it stirred up quite a bit of controversy >.>

03:40:51
<transcript>: A bot that calls like Bristors. Yeah. So you could get a bot that would get, like, a high reputation. Everyone knew when they saw it. It was truth. That might that might help.

03:40:51
<transcript>: get people

03:40:54
<transcript>: Get people to follow the right people. Yeah.

03:40:54
<transcript>: there are great

03:40:55
oskrm: I mean just copy-paste stuff and cut till you something work

03:41:05
<transcript>: There are great. That's the thing about Twitter, there's the good of Twitter. And you can't throw the whole thing out because there are people you can like, interact with the people at the top of their fields on Twitter. And that's so great.

03:41:07
<transcript>: Before Twitter.

03:41:07
<transcript>: there

03:41:13
cowfacedude99: raid!!!!!

03:41:13
ohmymndy: Theo can be seen as controversial, but I really like his attitude and the way he explains things by drawing

03:41:14
stroopwafel26: tbh all threads on twitter ruin the experience for me, I don't want my entire timelime filled up with a dumn thread which should have been a blog post

03:41:17
nexxeln: yoo raid

03:41:19
<transcript>: There wasn't so much access to that, like to reaching out to people who really, genuinely have the experience and can save you a ton of time. And those types, those types of people often share with what they know.

03:41:19
<transcript>: it

03:41:22
cowfacedude99: hi @star_ansible

03:41:24
<transcript>: It's just sifting through all the Grift star ends here.

03:41:24
<transcript>: starens

03:41:26
<transcript>: Starens will rating.

03:41:27
star_ansible: i g2g goodluck

03:41:29
nate_codes: @cyberimmersion Grifter Callout bot? https://www.youtube.com/c/Coffeezilla LUL

03:41:29
star_ansible: bless u

03:41:32
<transcript>: Takes me back to the to my very first few streams when starring me.

03:41:32
<transcript>: welcome star

03:41:37
<transcript>: Welcome Star Ensubl. We're talking about how much I hate Twitter, which is maybe not great content. I'm sorry.

03:41:46
<transcript>: It has to be a systematic change on Twitter side. Yeah. Maybe. Maybe it's a Twitter problem. Part of it is at least.

03:41:51
<transcript>: Monday mornings. The worst. Yeah. They probably have them all scheduled for Monday morning.

03:41:51
<transcript>: i got

03:41:52
oskrm: ~ Hydrate

03:41:55
<transcript>: I got tired. There was like a stretch of time where it was like every Monday.

03:41:55
<transcript>: before i

03:42:02
<transcript>: Before I started blocking people Liberally, it was like the same exact tweet from like a dozen people every Monday.

03:42:02
<transcript>: you know

03:42:05
dnbull: @OhMyMndy the issue with that video is that he "backtrack" because he didnt know it was a "certain" person. Though, I do appreciate him apologizing for it but just because you didnt know doesnt mean you should be an ahole about it

03:42:07
cyberimmersion: @adamdotdev how would you suggest i get better with like react stuff? or.. since this t3 stuff seems interesting, whats your advice? i've just recently started learning and done like 2 or 3 real projects

03:42:08
<transcript>: You know, you got a good job when you love Monday, when you're looking forward to Monday, like, I just. I hate that stuff.

03:42:09
infinite_entropy_: twitter sucks, I wouldn't buy it for 44 billion dollars

03:42:10
barneyoftherubble: Elon "not so buying" Musk will fix twitter

03:42:19
cowfacedude99: how long are you going with the rant?

03:42:23
<transcript>: What's wrong with the audio is my audio wrong reader. There's something wrong, Brandy. Welcome to Chat. Hey, Adam, I don't even use TS, but loving the stream connected with you on Twitter, by the way. Cool, Brandy. I appreciate that.

03:42:29
<transcript>: Yeah, I do use quite a bit. Oh, Geez, now I have a cowboy hat. How are you gonna take me seriously now.

03:42:29
<transcript>: i do use

03:42:33
2dorkstv: lol. I look forward to monday, but mostly because I'm a creature of routine and I like the structure

03:42:33
<transcript>: I do use a lot of TypeScript, but I also love you being here in the stream.

03:42:35
nexxeln: @cyberimmersion just build stuff

03:42:40
oskrm: accent

03:42:44
<transcript>: You've lived in the world if you're 22. Yeah, that's the problem, Tomo. I think is the younger people who they don't have context for a lot of things. And they don't know that there's people out there.

03:42:44
<transcript>: what was that no

03:42:44
tomofromearth___: Audio sounds fine.

03:42:48
<transcript>: What was that noise? I don't know. Somebody just did something and it made a noise. But I didn't see it.

03:42:48
<transcript>: i

03:42:48
cyberimmersion: yeah wheres the accent?

03:42:53
nate_codes: Welp it appears prod ops may have blown up the k8s config for one of my (in-dev thankfully) projects....gtg login to the office

03:42:53
<transcript>: I think somebody just subscribed and I appreciate that it's not showing up in my feed for some reason.

03:42:53
dinisskizee: back from holidays :)

03:42:55
<transcript>: It's scary.

03:42:55
<transcript>: tech

03:42:57
sergioquijano: I love that mindset, foot on the ground :D

03:42:59
<transcript>: Tech education industry really since the there was a code school that has huge legal issues.

03:42:59
<transcript>: their makeup

03:43:06
<transcript>: Their makeup. Yeah. The incubators. There's some bad ones. There's some bad eggs there. And then there's some good ones. So it's hard because.

03:43:06
<transcript>: i

03:43:10
<transcript>: I think there are people genuinely doing great work. I think of like Egg head.

03:43:18
nate_codes: t3ggWave t3ggWave t3ggWave t3ggWave t3ggWave t3ggWave have a wonderful Tuesday everybody! Take it easy, stoked to have caught you live Adam!

03:43:18
<transcript>: Joel and Egg Head Folks, they're doing really great work, but it's hard when.

03:43:20
cyberimmersion: @nexxeln so im kind of stuck on what i should build, how do you come up with stuff to build?

03:43:23
<transcript>: You're in an industry where there are people who take advantage.

03:43:29
<transcript>: And it's hard because you can't make general statements like all educators are bad.

03:43:29
<transcript>: but

03:43:31
nate_codes: @nexxeln keep being amazing, ty for ct3a

03:43:36
<transcript>: But it's it's it sucks that for the new people, it's hard for them to make those.

03:43:36
<transcript>: to decide

03:43:44
<transcript>: To decide because people are marketing and they're all this stuff you got to sift through. You're just trying to make your way. I don't know. It all frustrates me a lot.

03:43:44
<transcript>: does it

03:43:45
<transcript>: Does it.

03:43:48
oskrm: @nexxeln look around you, someone has to have a problem for you to fix

03:43:50
<transcript>: Yeah? The threads? The threads? The threads.

03:43:54
<transcript>: I do see a lot of people talking about this lately.

03:43:54
<transcript>: and that encourages

03:43:58
parcodek: Im back

03:43:59
cyberimmersion: @adamdotdev yeah i feel like im one of those people trying to find my way

03:44:01
shahin8520: !neovim

03:44:01
nexxeln: @cyberimmersion you can build stuff to solve problems you have, or someone else has. you can also clone websites you like

03:44:01
<transcript>: And that encourages me. That like, maybe maybe we're doing something. Maybe we get tired of it enough that something happens.

03:44:06
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:44:06
<transcript>: wanna feel

03:44:08
shahin8520: !config

03:44:11
nexxeln: @nate_codes 💜

03:44:15
<transcript>: Wanna Feels latest video about this scam Sorry Kiss perform. Yeah, that was the topic of a lot of conversation yesterday. Mandy, I don't know if you noticed on Twitch. Hey, Barney, I'm great. How are you.

03:44:18
<transcript>: Quite a bit country. Yeah.

03:44:25
<transcript>: Copy stuff and cut to something. Work. Yeah. Oh, wow. I'm so behind on chat. Okay, I got it. I gotta skip ahead.

03:44:29
oskrm: where is the accent

03:44:36
<transcript>: Is here. I'm just reading all of this and okay, welcome to Chat. Infinite Entropy. Twitter sucks. I wouldn't buy it for $44 billion. That's right.

03:44:47
<transcript>: How am I going with this rant? I don't know. I'm gonna get back to actually coding and stuff. Does that sound fun? I'm just trying to read chat and I'm just I'm way behind and I'm trying to at least do the first time chatters.

03:44:47
<transcript>: shaheen

03:44:55
<transcript>: Shaheen, welcome to Chat. You could dot files, you'll get my neovim config. Oh, Geez, calface, Rickroll.

03:44:55
<transcript>: this will be just

03:44:57
<transcript>: This will be just shoving me back into it.

03:45:02
<transcript>: You're gonna force me to share my screen.

03:45:02
<transcript>: that's fair

03:45:02
shahin8520: thanks, hi

03:45:04
cyberimmersion: @nexxeln yeah at this moment i can't think of problems i have to solve at the moment, copying websites seems like a good idea

03:45:05
<transcript>: That's fair, that's fair. Cow, base.

03:45:05
<transcript>: we'll get a little rack out

03:45:07
shahin8520: !dotfiles

03:45:07
<transcript>: We'll get a little rack out and then we'll get back to it.

03:45:08
fossabot: Adam's dotfiles live here: https://github.com/adamelmore/dotfiles

03:45:12
cowfacedude99: I had the points back from last time LUL

03:45:15
<transcript>: Okay.

03:45:15
<transcript>: we're done

03:45:17
<transcript>: We're done. Ranting.

03:45:18
ohmymndy: Wooohooooo yeah

03:45:20
<transcript>: Where is the accent.

03:45:20
<transcript>: am i supposed

03:45:22
<transcript>: Am I supposed to have an accent.

03:45:26
turklerburada: no we cant hear it

03:45:26
ohmymndy: Too bad no audio though

03:45:35
<transcript>: Cyber. Emerson, you're trying to find your way. Yeah, just I would avoid taking too much advice from Twitter. That's my advice. It's simplified. And it's a shame, because there's some good stuff there on Twitter.

03:45:35
<transcript>: but

03:45:41
oskrm: take from twitch chat KEKW

03:45:47
cyberimmersion: @adamdotdev im never really on social media.. im basically on twitch lol

03:45:51
mow_mi_wilku: Feels like only js lives on twitter

03:45:55
<transcript>: But until there's a solution to all the Griffith, I would be wary of anything you're reading on Twitter. I would run it by somebody, you know, if somebody tells you you should study these seven things because you read on a Twitter, maybe run that by a friend and say, Is this real? If you can find a friend, find a friend, find a friend that's doing what you want to do. Make a friend.

03:45:59
<transcript>: And and have them help you just run stuff through their filter.

03:45:59
<transcript>: okay

03:46:04
<transcript>: Okay, let's make a little more progress. I've just got another 30 minutes here.

03:46:08
<transcript>: Let's fix this timer thing because that seems like a quick one.

03:46:12
<transcript>: New window. I want a new.

03:46:14
dnbull: just build stop buying those courses and watching yt tutorials. hands on keyboard

03:46:17
<transcript>: Open the time to say the audio is messed up. Is there something wrong with the audio.

03:46:19
<transcript>: Geez.

03:46:19
<transcript>: no

03:46:21
<transcript>: No.

03:46:23
<transcript>: All of you know.

03:46:23
<transcript>: got

03:46:25
<transcript>: Gotta here okay.

03:46:27
<transcript>: Localhost.

03:46:33
oskrm: yo adam, try to play with https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/

03:46:38
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow Dark Rift. I appreciate it. Too bad. No audio. Oh, yeah. You can't hear the audio on the video. Sorry about that.

03:46:46
<transcript>: Twitch is where I place to be simury missing. I think so. I think there's a lot of people on Twitch that are worth following along and learning something from.

03:46:53
<transcript>: Handson keyboard. That's some good advice.

03:46:59
<transcript>: Okay, teachable machine with Google.com. What is this? What is this.

03:47:01
cyberimmersion: @adamdotdev i definitely need friends, i don't actually have friends that are into coding... in a few discords but i need to talk in there i guess

03:47:09
<transcript>: Train a computer recognize your own images, sounds, and poses fast Easy way to create machine learning models for your site. To ask them more interesting.

03:47:11
<transcript>: That sounds fun.

03:47:15
<transcript>: That sounds super fun. I will take a look at that.

03:47:15
<transcript>: after this

03:47:17
<transcript>: After this stream.

03:47:18
cowfacedude99: @dnbull As prime and teej say `TIME ON THE SADDLE`

03:47:19
barneyoftherubble: I am curious what has made so many of the JS coders suddenly want to use vim.

03:47:20
oskrm: you can train in browser

03:47:22
<transcript>: Definitely meet friends don't actually have friends that are into coding.

03:47:34
<transcript>: And a few discords. But I need to talk. Yeah. Discord is a great place to start interacting with people on discord. And that's probably a great place to meet some friends. Time on the saddle. That's right. Cow face.

03:47:34
<transcript>: prime

03:47:44
<transcript>: Prime and private teacher the best if you want to follow some people. Oh primary. It's time streaming right now. Okay, you should probably not be following me if Private's on.

03:47:44
<transcript>: it's

03:47:45
cowfacedude99: yes

03:47:50
<transcript>: It's gonna be more enjoyable for you to go watch prime. I'm just gonna say it, let's come out and say it. I'll be done here in 30 minutes.

03:47:50
<transcript>: i like

03:47:53
<transcript>: I like hanging out with you, but prime is.

03:47:53
<transcript>: he's

03:47:55
<transcript>: He's the Greatest show.

03:47:55
<transcript>: on twitch

03:47:57
<transcript>: On Twitch.

03:48:01
<transcript>: How's this thing a great show on Earth. But he's the he's the best.

03:48:01
<transcript>: or i'll just

03:48:03
<transcript>: Or I'll just trying to.

03:48:03
<transcript>: try and

03:48:04
<transcript>: Try and.

03:48:04
<transcript>: meet that

03:48:07
oskrm: what do you mean? watchin prime rn thx @Dendenguy

03:48:07
<transcript>: Meet that bar. We're not meeting. It.

03:48:07
<transcript>: he's he's

03:48:08
stroopwafel26: I like the vibe here better than over at primes, sorry not sorry

03:48:09
<transcript>: He's, He's, awesome.

03:48:13
<transcript>: Okay, so what was the problem here? We have.

03:48:17
<transcript>: Daylight. Okay.

03:48:17
<transcript>: so those

03:48:20
cyberimmersion: @dnbull thanks, i spend to much time doing that

03:48:20
<transcript>: So those are those are not dates.

03:48:20
<transcript>: links

03:48:22
<transcript>: Links, is a number.

03:48:22
<transcript>: the link

03:48:26
<transcript>: The link is much smaller than the current number is so big.

03:48:31
<transcript>: How's that so big? Why is it so big? That's milliseconds.

03:48:35
dnbull: Prime is a great streamer but i dont enjoy his chat lol I prefer being here

03:48:36
turklerburada: thats what she said Kappa

03:48:42
<transcript>: I guess if I did is it the same if I did a date new date get time. Is that the same.

03:48:46
<transcript>: I said.

03:48:46
<transcript>: new date

03:48:48
<transcript>: New date.

03:48:50
<transcript>: Get time.

03:48:52
<transcript>: Like that.

03:48:52
<transcript>: is that the same

03:48:53
cowfacedude99: As I was asking. why are you using start, now and current all at once, @adamdotdev

03:48:53
<transcript>: Is that the same.

03:48:56
<transcript>: Current still.

03:48:56
<transcript>: so di

03:48:58
<transcript>: So diet.

03:49:00
stroopwafel26: @dnbull yeah his chat is bit toxic, maybe too strong a word, i can't think of anything else

03:49:04
<transcript>: Clear that log. Here we go. Still giant. Okay.

03:49:04
<transcript>: so

03:49:07
<transcript>: So better to stick with that now.

03:49:11
<transcript>: So that's in milliseconds.

03:49:11
<transcript>: right

03:49:12
<transcript>: Right.

03:49:12
2dorkstv: I love Prime's vibe, but yours is perfect for the morning. He's thrash metal, you're smooth jazz

03:49:28
<transcript>: That's too funny.

03:49:29
cyberimmersion: @dnbull "passionate" ?

03:49:32
<transcript>: Current.

03:49:32
<transcript>: what

03:49:37
<transcript>: What is? So what's length? Why is link some smaller? Do I need to multiply it by a thousand.

03:49:40
<transcript>: Maybe.

03:49:43
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:49:44
dnbull: @stroopwafel26 I really love prime but he is producing some "toxic" viewers. I agree toxic too strong LUL

03:49:49
stream_kyle: I just saw the Twitter video. I didn't see the giant bowl coming.

03:49:52
<transcript>: I'm way off. Where is it.

03:49:52
<transcript>: i was up here

03:49:57
<transcript>: I was up here, right there we go. Lapse. Okay. Expires.

03:50:00
2dorkstv: @dnbull that probably comes with growth to some degree. You're gonna end up with a few

03:50:01
<transcript>: Let's do times a thousand why not.

03:50:05
<transcript>: Well, why not? Because maybe it's wrong. But.

03:50:05
dendenguy: Same, what's the giant bowl about

03:50:09
<transcript>: Aside from that. Why not.

03:50:15
<transcript>: Okay. No, I want just that character. There we go.

03:50:22
<transcript>: Okay, well, that got the number bigger, but still not near as big, though, right.

03:50:23
cyberimmersion: @dnbull prime is super high energy, so i think he draws in that energy

03:50:29
<transcript>: So that's that's not number of midlapse unit. That's what's it called epoch time. Right.

03:50:29
<transcript>: i

03:50:31
<transcript>: I need to do.

03:50:31
cowfacedude99: nice to see you using f and t.

03:50:41
<transcript>: What is? Start, gettime. Let's do that. Let's say start.

03:50:44
<transcript>: It time.

03:50:46
<transcript>: And then.

03:50:48
<transcript>: Expires.

03:50:49
stroopwafel26: anyway I like chill streams much more, prime is too high energy for me indeed

03:50:52
<transcript>: Get time.

03:50:56
dnbull: @2DorksTV Oh for sure, either way in the internet you get rid of it regardless of content anyway

03:50:57
stroopwafel26: to each their own

03:50:58
<transcript>: Okay. So those are all numbers of the same size.

03:50:58
trout_soda: same @stroopwafel26

03:51:04
<transcript>: Yeah. County. You know what? We fixed it. We fixed it by.

03:51:07
cowfacedude99: I think you need to use everything in a single size.

03:51:07
dnbull: can't** get

03:51:10
<transcript>: Slowing down my key. Repeat. I think you even maybe said something about that before.

03:51:12
<transcript>: Like.

03:51:12
<transcript>: very hard

03:51:17
<transcript>: Very hard now to vertically navigate with JMK, and to just like.

03:51:17
<transcript>: l and h

03:51:19
<transcript>: L and H my way around.

03:51:20
dendenguy: @adamdotdev Are you missing parenthesis in current - start.getTime() / length?

03:51:20
<transcript>: Because.

03:51:20
<transcript>: he repeat

03:51:23
<transcript>: He repeat, super slow. See this.

03:51:30
<transcript>: Hurts? Are you missing Prince these in current minus start git time via the link maybe am I.

03:51:30
<transcript>: so let's see

03:51:33
<transcript>: So let's see math floor current minus.

03:51:33
<transcript>: oh yeah

03:51:36
<transcript>: Oh yeah? Maybe we need to do.

03:51:39
<transcript>: These first right.

03:51:43
<transcript>: Like this.

03:51:45
<transcript>: Is that the problem.

03:51:48
<transcript>: Let's just log.

03:51:52
<transcript>: Console log, elapsed.

03:51:57
<transcript>: Let's not log all this stuff.

03:52:03
<transcript>: Zero.

03:52:06
<transcript>: Has elapsed How's that possible.

03:52:12
<transcript>: How is that possible.

03:52:17
dendenguy: bc of the floor, u have to multiply by 100

03:52:17
<transcript>: See still zero.

03:52:17
<transcript>: okay

03:52:18
<transcript>: Okay.

03:52:24
cyberimmersion: @adamdotdev as prime would say you can jump to the line you want to be at by typing a number and then j or k

03:52:24
<transcript>: Current minus.

03:52:24
<transcript>: art

03:52:26
<transcript>: Art git time.

03:52:27
dnbull: Is the keyboard you are currently using the correct one you display on your twitch profile section @adamdotdev

03:52:32
<transcript>: This should not be.

03:52:40
<transcript>: Percentage to me.

03:52:40
ohmymndy: I don't even bother learning the operator precedence, I just always use parentheses

03:52:48
<transcript>: Doesn't look like it. You know who I need? I need Mark here. He would just write the code because of the floor. You have to multiply by 100. Oh.

03:52:51
<transcript>: At that floor.

03:52:55
<transcript>: Matthew floor.

03:52:57
<transcript>: Where is it.

03:52:58
ohmymndy: Talking about keyboards, where is the keyboard view?

03:53:03
<transcript>: Times 100.

03:53:03
<transcript>: all right

03:53:05
<transcript>: All Right, no.

03:53:09
<transcript>: 400, 500, where I'm.

03:53:09
<transcript>: so should not be so

03:53:11
<transcript>: So should not be so hard. Why is this so hard.

03:53:15
<transcript>: At that floor is going to be.

03:53:18
tomofromearth___: Yo!  I gotta go start my studying I’ll be back!  Have a great rest of your day everyone.  🤙🏼

03:53:19
<transcript>: I have to multiply inside that by 100, yeah, Yeah.

03:53:20
tomofromearth___: tomofrOmTheOldBand

03:53:29
<transcript>: Still off. I think somebody just write the code for me.

03:53:29
<transcript>: as prime would say

03:53:36
cowfacedude99: one ( off I think

03:53:36
<transcript>: As prime would say, you can jump to the line you want to be at by typing a number and then JK. That's good. Call.

03:53:36
<transcript>: is the keyboard

03:53:43
<transcript>: Is the keyboard you're currently using the correct one you display on your Twitch Profile section. I Twitch Profile section.

03:53:48
<transcript>: I'm using the mode 80.

03:53:54
<transcript>: Mode 80 I don't know what's on my Twitch profile section, though.

03:53:56
<transcript>: See a Tomo.

03:53:56
<transcript>: enjoy

03:53:58
<transcript>: Enjoy.

03:54:01
<transcript>: And I'll look forward to seeing you again.

03:54:03
<transcript>: Later.

03:54:09
dnbull: Yeah sounds correct, it says Mode Eighty 2022

03:54:11
<transcript>: Cyberness, cyber things most would follow in Shaheen as well. Thank you guys.

03:54:11
<transcript>: for girls

03:54:22
<transcript>: For girls. I use guys gender neutral, but I don't know if that's actually gender neutral. I just use it, like for everybody guys, but it sounds kind of sounds wrong.

03:54:25
dendenguy: Try: Math.floor((current - start.getTime()) * 100 / length)

03:54:31
<transcript>: Mode 80. 22. That's it. Yep. The Embol. That's the keyboard I'm using right now. That's right. Try math upflower. Thank you. Din Din woo. Here we go.

03:54:36
<transcript>: This is what Mark would always do. He just write all the code for me. I miss Mark.

03:54:36
<transcript>: i don't

03:54:38
ohmymndy: Folks, peeps, people

03:54:39
<transcript>: I don't expect anything of him. I just miss him.

03:54:42
<transcript>: Delete.

03:54:45
<transcript>: To.

03:54:49
<transcript>: No delete.

03:54:51
dnbull: You can say, "all, everyone, folks, people", etc.

03:54:55
<transcript>: There's too many prints.

03:54:58
<transcript>: This is really cool thing.

03:55:01
stroopwafel26: ya'll

03:55:03
<transcript>: Copy that.

03:55:06
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:55:08
<transcript>: I have thought floor.

03:55:13
<transcript>: Okay. Let's try that.

03:55:16
ohmymndy: Put on the cowboy hat and ya'll away

03:55:22
<transcript>: Folks peeps people. Thank you, Mandy. That's way better. I gotta get you the same folks. I say folks a lot so that's that seems.

03:55:25
<transcript>: Y'all.

03:55:35
<transcript>: Folks, I think folks is gonna be most natural for me because I live in the Midwest, and there's a lot of people saying, folks around here, so I'll stick with that.

03:55:38
barneyoftherubble: folks is such a boomer word

03:55:42
<transcript>: Whoa, 2020. These are not numbers I expected. It's not a percentage. What's wrong? Here.

03:55:42
<transcript>: current

03:55:43
dnbull: boomer Kappa

03:55:46
<transcript>: Current minus start get time.

03:55:53
<transcript>: Do I need to remove some of the precision.

03:55:53
<transcript>: from

03:55:56
<transcript>: From data now like do like divided by a thousand.

03:55:56
<transcript>: something

03:55:58
<transcript>: Something.

03:55:58
<transcript>: no

03:55:59
<transcript>: No, definitely not that.

03:56:03
<transcript>: So hard.

03:56:04
cyberimmersion: @adamdotdev alright, well ima lurk but i wanna build a copy of a website for practice like suggested :)

03:56:05
<transcript>: This is not a hard problem.

03:56:12
<transcript>: Every hundred milliseconds. I'm checking the current time. I'm setting a lapse to.

03:56:12
<transcript>: current

03:56:16
<transcript>: Current minus start guitar let's remove the math floor for now.

03:56:20
trout_soda: JS date isn't known for being straightforward :)

03:56:30
<transcript>: Do that. Let's say current minus start get time times 100 divided by links. So that's just leaving.

03:56:30
<transcript>: those dec

03:56:31
<transcript>: Those Decimals on there.

03:56:34
<transcript>: Links.

03:56:40
<transcript>: What am I doing here.

03:56:46
<transcript>: Yeah, no worries? Cyber lurkaway.

03:56:49
<transcript>: Folks, is such a Boomer word, then it's perfect.

03:56:49
<transcript>: because

03:56:49
dnbull: JS dates gives me headaches, currently doing something with it at work.

03:56:53
<transcript>: Because I'm old, you know, kind of perfect for me.

03:56:59
stroopwafel26: ok boomer

03:57:03
<transcript>: Jsdate isn't known for being straightforward. Yeah, it's so true. Every time I do stuff with date math and just dates in general, driving that.

03:57:05
<transcript>: Okay.

03:57:05
<transcript>: well

03:57:07
<transcript>: Well, what do we think.

03:57:07
<transcript>: should i

03:57:09
<transcript>: Should I should I abandon.

03:57:09
<transcript>: i start over here

03:57:12
ohmymndy: What does { start, expires } = round, do?

03:57:19
<transcript>: I start over here. What's wrong? We have a start. We have expires. Those are time stamps. We can get the links, which is always just gonna be 10 seconds. That's just 10,000, right.

03:57:19
<transcript>: so

03:57:20
<transcript>: So.

03:57:24
<transcript>: That is just 10,000.

03:57:26
<transcript>: Right.

03:57:29
ohmymndy: Where is round coming from?

03:57:35
<transcript>: We're dividing by 10,000. We're trying to get the current. Oh, that's. Yeah, that's not right. Wait a minute. Why am I divided by 100.

03:57:35
<transcript>: the

03:57:36
<transcript>: The current.

03:57:39
barneyoftherubble: I think you should find a boomer camera effect to really reflect your age!

03:57:49
<transcript>: Is the current timestamp. We're subtracting the start timestamp that gets us how far we've gone. We need to divide that by.

03:57:49
<transcript>: so

03:57:54
<transcript>: So I think that's the problem I need to log that let's console that log.

03:57:59
<transcript>: Current minus start get time. What does that look like.

03:58:01
stroopwafel26: This is very relevant right now https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FdFzdpoWIAIHqJQ?format=jpg&name=large

03:58:06
cowfacedude99: console log everything LUL

03:58:08
<transcript>: So that's a big number. That is how many seconds of Elapse since this round started.

03:58:08
<transcript>: so it's

03:58:12
<transcript>: So it's 354 seconds. That makes sense. Okay.

03:58:16
<transcript>: If that's the total number of seconds that have elapsed.

03:58:23
<transcript>: And we need to divide by ten. 00:10 thousand. Not nearly big enough. Oh, because we're going past the timer.

03:58:23
<transcript>: that makes

03:58:36
<transcript>: That makes okay. That makes sense. So if I answer this, this number should change when new range kicks in. Now it's a smaller number. Now it's like, yeah, 5 seconds, six, seven, eight.

03:58:36
<transcript>: nine

03:58:39
<transcript>: Nine. So now that percentage might be right.

03:58:42
<transcript>: This might be right.

03:58:48
<transcript>: Yeah. We already passed 10 seconds. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So I answer this one.

03:58:48
<transcript>: it's gonna

03:58:53
<transcript>: It's gonna start out. Yeah, yeah. 36. Okay. That's correct.

03:58:53
<transcript>: it's

03:58:54
<transcript>: It's correct. Now.

03:58:54
<transcript>: those

03:58:59
<transcript>: Those are percentages. And I can do the math that floor on it now.

03:59:03
<transcript>: Oh, wait, do I need to multiply by a hundred.

03:59:06
<transcript>: I was only if we did map that for which we're gonna reintroduce, right.

03:59:14
<transcript>: Oh, Matt. Floor did not work. What did I do.

03:59:19
<transcript>: What's wrong.

03:59:23
<transcript>: What I do wrong.

03:59:27
<transcript>: Current minus start docket time.

03:59:33
<transcript>: I want to see this work before I'm done, but I do have to pee, and I'm going to have to be down here pretty quick.

03:59:41
<transcript>: 500 it looks right, except the floor is not working.

03:59:43
<transcript>: Right.

03:59:45
<transcript>: At that floor.

03:59:53
<transcript>: Oh, I'm flooring now I'm flooring not soon enough.

04:00:01
<transcript>: Here we go. Okay. We're good enough.

04:00:01
<transcript>: let's

04:00:03
<transcript>: Let's go down here.

04:00:08
<transcript>: Let's do this.

04:00:13
<transcript>: Still wrong.

04:00:13
<transcript>: laps it's too big

04:00:19
<transcript>: Laps. It's too big. It's not a percentage that's divided by a hundred.

04:00:22
<transcript>: So I just need to not multiply by 100 up here.

04:00:22
<transcript>: right

04:00:23
<transcript>: Right.

04:00:28
barneyoftherubble: can you hear the tap drip?

04:00:28
<transcript>: It is.

04:00:28
<transcript>: nope

04:00:29
<transcript>: Nope.

04:00:32
<transcript>: Nope Nope Nope.

04:00:32
<transcript>: wait

04:00:33
<transcript>: Wait.

04:00:33
<transcript>: is that

04:00:36
<transcript>: Is that right? I have to be so bad.

04:00:36
<transcript>: i just need to

04:00:38
<transcript>: I just need to go when I have to pee.

04:00:38
<transcript>: this looks

04:00:41
<transcript>: This looks wrong. Divide by 100. Maybe.

04:00:41
<transcript>: la

04:00:44
<transcript>: Lapse.

04:00:46
ohmymndy: Is it possible to also show abolute line numbers? Could be handy to ask questions about the code or give some hints/tips?

04:00:47
<transcript>: Okay.

04:00:47
<transcript>: laps

04:00:50
<transcript>: Laps by a hundred.

04:00:51
dendenguy: Refresh to reset the time again?

04:00:53
barneyoftherubble: Think of all that water you should be drinking

04:01:01
<transcript>: Okay, well, I hate to end it on so close to having that timer working. I hate to, but I have to pee too bad, and I don't want to make you guys wait through a break.

04:01:01
<transcript>: just

04:01:06
<transcript>: Just to come back and be like, Well, gotta go? Cause I gotta go in ten minutes anyway? So.

04:01:09
<transcript>: We'll get it fixed.

04:01:09
<transcript>: tomorrow if i

04:01:35
