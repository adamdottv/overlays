00:19:11
<transcript>: a month

<transcript>: A month so I don't know if it still works. We got to test it out.

00:19:30
<transcript>: Yeah, I'm just all over the place. I'm sorry. I think the stream should. Mostly aside from me being in a different place, it should mostly be impact. I don't think I destroyed everything. Although the lighting we found out was destroyed.

00:19:30

00:19:32
<transcript>: Let's get to it. Are we ready.

00:19:41
<transcript>: yeah

hambonemcglone: You need a nice conductor’s cap when the train gets going

00:44:57
<transcript>: Oh yeah. I should also mention all these gifted subs, all the payouts I get from Twitch, which are not much. I mean, you don't really make much money on Twitch, but all the payouts I get we donate to charitable organizations. I've only gotten one payout, but we donate it to.

00:44:57
<transcript>: organizations

00:45:05
<transcript>: Organizations doing work in diversity in Tech. That's like if I'm passionate about charitable organizations, it's that group of charitable organizations.

00:45:05
<transcript>: and

00:45:11
<transcript>: And that's what we do. So last month or last payout was just a few weeks ago.

00:45:11
<transcript>: we

00:45:19
<transcript>: We donated that to Girls Who Code, which is an organization that helps young girls get into Sims.

00:45:27
janeosaka: Good org

00:45:30
<transcript>: Okay. So. Yeah. Thank you so much. All those gifted subs, all that money will roll into some organization doing good work on that front. Welcome to Chat deepara.

00:45:33
absenth762: That's awesome!  I'm trying to get my 13yo daughter interested in the local Girls who Code

00:45:36
tafiir: really surreal hearing you say that in that outfit LUL

00:45:38
<transcript>: Alright Wetsie. Thank you for the follow I guess let's get back to building the thing right.

00:45:40
<transcript>: I need a conductor's. Cap.

00:45:40
<transcript>: the chain is going

00:45:43
tafiir: but awesome thing you do!

00:45:44
<transcript>: The chain is going, That's a good idea. Hembum. I like that.

00:45:49
<transcript>: Oh, there's unlimited high trains now you can go to Infinity.

00:45:52
<transcript>: Really.

00:45:55

deadrobotdev: @Delvoid RIP. I made an overlay widget for someone when it was just 5 levels. Might need to tweak it now to show the current level number as well.

00:45:58
<transcript>: Funny to see in this outfit. Let me talk about diversity in tech.

00:46:08
<transcript>: Okay, the giveaway thing is it's such a big block attack that's making it hard for me to follow chat today.

00:46:13
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. And Stroop matched our donation last time.

00:46:15
<transcript>: So.

00:46:15
<transcript>: i don't know if

00:46:24
akawr: oh wait you can

00:46:25
akawr: fuck

00:46:35
<transcript>: I don't know if I'm supposed to talk about how much I make on Twitch. I think I read something about you can get banned if you talk about your payouts. So next time I probably won't say how much the payout is because I don't want to do something against the rules. That's the problem with rules. If you don't know the rules, you can't follow them. I'm a rule follower to my core, like I cannot stink. The idea of breaking rules.

00:46:36
nexxeln: you can talk about it i think, not sure tho

00:46:57
2dorkstv: oh man, I am incredibly averse to getting in trouble. Rule follower all the way

00:47:01
absenth762: Rule #1:  Death Before Decaff!

00:47:06
<transcript>: I don't. I didn't read that like I didn't. For what it's worth, I didn't read that on some list of rules on Twitch. I just saw someone say that, like on Twitter or something, which means it's probably not true.

00:47:10
<transcript>: Okay. So I want to do, like, a I want to copy.

<transcript>: I feel like this could get out of hand. And you guys, I'm regretting anything. You know, I don't want this to be a thing where you got carried away, you got a little drunk, you gave way too many subs, and then you leave my stream with a bad taste in your mouth. I'm hoping you don't leave the street with a bad taste in your mouth. So please.

00:56:38

<transcript>: Let's just make sure we don't get too carried away, okay.

00:56:53
<transcript>: I can't keep up with Chad today. I'm sorry I'm trying, but I also want to give away a keyboard, and so I gotta focus.

00:56:53

00:56:55
<transcript>: Here's what we're gonna do? We're gonna say.

00:57:05
developmentrobot: @adamdotdev are you ever gonna go to a twitchcon?

00:57:06
<transcript>: Start just like that. It's that easy.

00:57:06
<transcript>: nothing else

00:57:08
<transcript>: Nothing else to it.

00:57:12
nate_codes: @FragAverage Keep in mind SUBTEMBER DISCOUNT DOES NOT APPLY TO GIVING OF GIFTS, ONLY THE CONVERSION OF GIFTS! CONVERT BEFORE THE MONTH ENDS

00:57:13
<transcript>: So is that async.

00:57:13
<transcript>: no

00:57:14
<transcript>: No.

00:57:17
<transcript>: Synchronous, operation.

00:57:19
akawr: the math is mathing

00:57:20
<transcript>: And then I can just copy all this.

00:57:20
<transcript>: let's

00:57:24
<transcript>: Let's do like Yank like that.

00:57:29
<transcript>: Then I can go over here and add the same thing which just happened.

00:57:33
<transcript>: Let me put something on my face what just happens.

00:57:35
<transcript>: Go over my keyboard.

00:57:45
laytanl_: Gifting is also 25% off for me

00:57:46
deadrobotdev: @nate_codes Nah, it looks like it does apply to gift subs.

00:57:47
<transcript>: Oh, oh, no keep in mind Subtembered discount does not apply to gifting of gifts. Giving of gifts only the conversion of gifts conferred before the month ends.

00:57:49
fragaverage: @FragAverage It applies to the cost of gifts directly

00:57:49
<transcript>: Whew.

00:57:54
<transcript>: See, you guys are doing that at full cost.

00:57:57
<transcript>: Okay.

00:57:57
<transcript>: so

00:58:01

<transcript>: End.

00:58:04
<transcript>: Right here.

00:58:10
<transcript>: Let's see next is don't need that.

00:58:17
nate_codes: @FragAverage I gave gifts and went into their terms at the beginning of the month and this was not the case...10x gifts = $50

00:58:19
<transcript>: Move that declaration, and then this is going to be end. Look at that. That was so easy. So now we have API routes.

00:58:19
<transcript>: for give

00:58:23
<transcript>: For giveaway or giveaway start and giveaway end.

00:58:23
<transcript>: now

00:58:30
akawr: what, it's 25% off for me too

00:58:33
stroopwafel26: What happens if you have say 10 people in chat, and you gift 20 subs? Everyone gets 2 months?

00:58:36
fragaverage: 25% off for me too LUL

00:58:37
<transcript>: Now when I start the giveaway it resets the state and allows entries. Oh, we didn't. We didn't make it a lot entries. Let's do that. So any and we're gonna make it like announced in chat. You can now.

00:58:37

absenth762: @nate_codes there was an update yesterday about Subtember.

00:58:49
<transcript>: So let's go back to our giveaway controller.

00:58:52
deadrobotdev: @nate_codes I believe it's changed for the final few days of Subtember

00:58:53

<transcript>: Okay.

00:59:02
stroopwafel26: @FragAverage makes sense, thanks

00:59:10
<transcript>: Here's our giveaway controller. When we start, we need to do a couple other things. We need to send a message.

00:59:14
<transcript>: So we need the OBS.

00:59:14
<transcript>: no

00:59:17
<transcript>: No. The Twitch controller.

00:59:18
deadrobotdev: What if all historic viewers have subs? 🤔

00:59:21
nate_codes: @DeadRobotDev ahhh thank you

00:59:22
<transcript>: Right. This is where you can send chat messages.

00:59:28

00:59:36
<transcript>: Shell? What.

00:59:37
akawr: twitch can't just automatically charge u later after you've gifted subs

00:59:39
fragaverage: maybe relevent viewers of the category? unsure tbh

00:59:40
<transcript>: Redeem meeting. Oh, yeah. I tried to do that. It didn't work.

denis_sk: @jackysono Comfortable for sure. Split and concave design makes the keys much closer together = less stretching

01:07:13
<transcript>: There's a place where we do this, where we send yeah, here we go. Enable Rewards. This is on the Twitch.

01:07:19
<transcript>: This controller is well, we're gonna have a specific like, enable one reward, right.

<transcript>: Thanks for being patient with me, everybody while we work through this today.

01:07:46
<transcript>: You all I trust are just talking away what's up, beardage? Welcome.

01:07:55
<transcript>: What switches does I have so the Kinesis keyboard. I don't know. It's sweet is that they ship with it. And can someone look that up.

01:07:55
<transcript>: i don't

01:07:58
<transcript>: I don't think you can switch them out.

01:07:58
<transcript>: i'd

01:08:02
beardage: I think it ships with mx browns

01:08:04
<transcript>: I'd Dennis ideas. I do not use an Advantage 360 or so myself. I use a mode keyboard.

01:08:19
<transcript>: So. No, I do not use it. I believe prime uses it, though I know prime uses it. What am I talking about? Acting like I'm not sure. I think the Primagin might use it. Like I watch prime every time he streams. Of course he. I know he uses it.

01:08:20
denis_sk: Yes I believe Advantage 360 has browns

01:08:29
<transcript>: Just in case, you know, put your curse over word and hit star it will put that word into your search. Oh, really.

<transcript>: Okay.

01:10:27
denis_sk: @Absenth762 I think Advantage 360 Pro supports ZMK

<transcript>: when

01:11:38

<transcript>: Enable disable. Okay, so here's what we need to do. We need to go back to our.

01:11:59
<transcript>: Think this should be in the giveaway controller. I just I can't.

01:12:00
stroopwafel26: I'm Dutch so of course I like free stuff

01:12:04
<transcript>: Have a circular dependency. So what I want to do.

01:12:05
sikmofo: your milkshake brings all the boys to the yard

01:12:07
<transcript>: What do I want to do here.

01:12:11
<transcript>: Giveaway controller versus Twitch controller.

01:12:19
<transcript>: I don't know what I want to do here.

01:12:28
<transcript>: Controller uses the Giveaways controller to redeem intrans.

01:12:32
<transcript>: I can flip that around and have it like as an event.

01:12:32
<transcript>: i think

01:12:34
<transcript>: I think that's what I should do.

01:12:38
<transcript>: I think that's what I think I should do. That.

01:12:38
<transcript>: but now

01:12:40
<transcript>: But now Twitch controller.

01:12:45
<transcript>: Twist controller is not going to have a giveaway's controller.

01:12:48
<transcript>: And that means.

01:12:55
<transcript>: What does that mean.

01:13:01
<transcript>: Here instead of redeeming. Giveaway entry. We just omit.

01:13:03
<transcript>: We omit.

01:13:03
<transcript>: like

01:13:06
<transcript>: Like a new entry or something.

01:13:08
<transcript>: As an event.

01:13:08
<transcript>: yeah

01:13:08
svrooij: @stroopwafel26 😁 altijd die Nederlanders....

<transcript>: Yeah, right.

01:13:10
hambonemcglone: I am a giveaway gremlin. I’m also in Eastern time this week, so I can actually watch :p

01:13:13
stroopwafel26: So I renewed my AWS solutions architect professional certificate for the fifth time yesterday and I never got the email that I passed, I discovered I passed by logging in to certmetrics. Great UX

01:13:15
<transcript>: And when I say, emit.

01:13:16
<transcript>: Do I mean.

01:13:22
<transcript>: What I mean, I think the thing already emits some stuff. I think it's already.

01:13:22
<transcript>: what's that

01:13:25
<transcript>: What's that called an event. Emitter.

01:13:28
<transcript>: This emit.

<transcript>: yeah

01:13:31
<transcript>: Yeah? Oh, this.

01:13:38
<transcript>: We could say.

01:13:38
<transcript>: this

01:13:40
<transcript>: This emit.

01:13:50
<transcript>: Giveaway entry.

01:13:50
<transcript>: and

01:13:55
hambonemcglone: @stroopwafel26 I despise the exam feedback.

01:13:57
<transcript>: Username.

01:13:59
<transcript>: Right.

01:14:06
<transcript>: And then this is just going away.

01:14:11
<transcript>: So now we need to listen to this event in our other thing.

01:14:15
<transcript>: Right new giveaway entry.

01:14:19
absenth762: @stroopwafel26 I let mine expire last November.  If I'm honest I only took the cert, to get away from the crowds and noise at ReInvent for an hour or two.

01:14:19
<transcript>: Username I don't love.

01:14:19
<transcript>: this

01:14:21
<transcript>: This username.

01:14:25
<transcript>: Okay.

01:14:30
<transcript>: I'm gonna undo that because I want to do that the cool way.

01:14:30
<transcript>: like i was

01:14:36
<transcript>: Like, I was here. And I was like, I'm gonna change that to username. And that was great. But then I should have been like.

01:14:36
<transcript>: that

01:14:41
stroopwafel26: @stroopwafel26 lol I can relate, I went to re:invent once and it completely drained me

01:14:43
<transcript>: That right. Or I should just use Gr and renamed it. What do I use for that? I use something for that.

01:14:48
<transcript>: Thank you for the following seven ill? T.

01:14:48
<transcript>: i feel

01:14:55

01:16:53

01:17:02
<transcript>: Yeah. Lsp? Rename. That's what I was saying. Dennis, I should have used Gr. I use something for that. I use the language server, but I thought I used a plugin that helped me with it. I don't remember.

01:21:00
<transcript>: Means I need to go in. We'll fix it in a minute.

01:21:04
nate_codes: @nate_codes :'(

<transcript>: This. That Twitch. We're doing so much funny things.

01:21:12
<transcript>: So.

01:21:20

01:21:20
<transcript>: is that good height

01:21:22
<transcript>: Is that good? Heightened.

<transcript>: for my family

01:21:48
nate_codes: Yeah Cons are not the best for the introverted...wife and I are decided to take a weekend trip to SD and I'm gonna spend some time at the con. She's probably going to stay in the hotel room 80% of the con time though :P

01:21:49

01:21:56
absenth762: Need a Software & Game Dev Con....  where nobody gets closer than 25km of one another.

01:35:27
<transcript>: Clickbait people. I'm really, honestly not. I just don't know how else to do a giveaway. I don't want to just open it up to everyone that follows me on Twitter and be like.

01:35:27
<transcript>: i'm gonna randomly

01:35:35
<transcript>: I'm gonna randomly give it to somebody. I want to be somebody who hangs out with me on Twitch here. And I think the only way to do that is through ChannelPoint rewards. I don't know how else I would do it.

01:35:50
<transcript>: I'm gonna save the oneonone call so you can tell me all about AWS, you bet that would be fun, Devoyed. I would love it. I'm waiting for someone to redeem that I'm excited about getting on with you. Maybe I'll make it cheaper so more people can. I just can't do it so that, like everybody's doing it. And then all my days are spent just on oneonones.

01:35:50
<transcript>: i feel like

01:35:54
<transcript>: I feel like I work somewhere again. Like having oneonone calls.

01:35:59

<transcript>: It could be giveaway toggle toggle on and off. It's a little less explicit, and it makes me nervous. So I'm not gonna do that just today, but.

01:45:47
<transcript>: That's a good idea.

01:45:47
deadrobotdev: THIS IS A TEST RUN, do not redeem this time

01:45:49
<transcript>: In the way.

01:45:56
<transcript>: It's okay dead robot. No one will be able to redeem it. It's like 4 million points.

01:46:00

01:47:09
theruggedbear: did you enable it ?

01:47:13

01:48:50
<transcript>: Didn't work, though.

01:48:58

01:49:06
<transcript>: That's fine. Yeah, I am. Rita. It's gonna be 300. Sorry. It just that was a test. It's a test. We're just testing.

01:52:57
deadrobotdev: Someone suggested checking you hardcoded the right event id

01:52:58
<transcript>: I can't remember now dialy, Hello, dialy. We're giving away a keyboard. I'm just trying to build it into the overlay.

01:53:00
<transcript>: Thing.

01:53:15
<transcript>: let's make sure

01:53:19
<transcript>: Let's make sure we hard code the right of NID.

01:53:19
<transcript>: how

01:53:21
<transcript>: How can I make sure of that.

01:53:24
raestrict: Did you giveaway yet?

01:53:27
<transcript>: Edit. Does it show me the ID here somewhere.

01:53:31
<transcript>: Does it show me the ID.

01:53:38
<transcript>: I don't see it. Oh, you know what? I know what the problem is. I know what's? Promise? That's a good call out.

01:53:38
<transcript>: i know it's

01:53:40
<transcript>: I know it's. Promise. We need to delete this entry.

01:53:44
<transcript>: Delete that entry.

01:53:49
<transcript>: I think I created it not in my overlays. And you can't do that.

01:53:56
<transcript>: i'm gonna look

01:53:56
<transcript>: So let's see. You can't do that. I'm gonna delete this entry.

01:53:58
<transcript>: I'm gonna look.

01:53:58
<transcript>: let's see

01:54:00
<transcript>: Let's see. We're gonna go back to.

01:54:01
deadrobotdev: @bausmeier Was the one who suggested checking it

01:54:06
<transcript>: Giveaway.

01:54:09
<transcript>: so we're gonna

01:54:09
<transcript>: Give like a constant up here, right? That I just added.

01:54:13
<transcript>: So we're gonna have to update that. But now I need to.

01:54:19
<transcript>: get it to

01:54:19
<transcript>: I need to restart my my overlays. I think.

01:54:25
<transcript>: I think.

01:54:25
<transcript>: i

01:54:31
<transcript>: I think so. Ignore that. Oh, this little guy. Don't worry about this little guy. This error. Don't worry about that.

01:54:37
<transcript>: Let's go over here now. It should have created it. It should be disabled. Still.

01:54:37
<transcript>: yeah

01:54:38
<transcript>: Yeah, Yeah.

01:54:45
<transcript>: Now this one is the right one so I can open up rewards again.

01:54:49
<transcript>: There it is. That's the correct.

01:54:50
<transcript>: Oh.

01:54:53
<transcript>: Okay.

01:54:53
<transcript>: y

01:54:55
<transcript>: Yank that.

01:54:57
<transcript>: And then.

01:55:05
<transcript>: I don't know how to do this. I want to paste that.

01:55:08
<transcript>: i'm saying

01:55:08
<transcript>: And then I want to like.

01:55:09
<transcript>: I'm saying.

01:55:12
bausmeier: vi:p

01:55:12
stephensaggyball: i see ur coding in assembly

01:55:14

01:55:15
bausmeier: vi"p

01:55:17
cristhianjhlcom: vip

01:55:17
<transcript>: I mean, I'm gonna do it this way, but I think there's a more elegant way to do that.

01:55:18
yaqoobarm: select with v and paste

01:55:19
danielgerep: vi"p

01:55:21
<transcript>: Okay. Now it's the right. Giveaway ID.

01:55:21
<transcript>: now

01:55:25
<transcript>: Now we came test it.

01:55:25
<transcript>: that's it again

01:55:28
<transcript>: That's it again. This is only a test if you're not listening.

01:55:34
<transcript>: this is

01:55:34
<transcript>: Testing again.

01:55:35
adamdotdev: TESTING AGAIN, THIS IS ONLY A TEST

01:55:36
<transcript>: This is only a test.

01:55:41
<transcript>: Come at me with. I can't do it. It's not working.

01:55:47
<transcript>: Okay. Now is it working? Do I have a 3 million point thing.

01:55:49
stephensaggyball: <==

01:55:52
<transcript>: Is it working? Did it do it? Did it do it.

01:55:52
<transcript>: so

01:55:53
yaqoobarm: it worked lost 30000000

01:55:57
<transcript>: So the reason I had to do it like this. You can't still not unpause.

01:56:03
carlosgn: you still have the enable to false

01:56:03
<transcript>: It works.

01:56:08
<transcript>: Oh, not Fan. Here we go, here we go.

01:56:08
<transcript>: custom rewards

01:56:15
<transcript>: Custom rewards this side in the query ID parameter, so there it is. Three, four, E, eight, BA, seven, four.

01:56:15
<transcript>: oh that

01:56:17
<transcript>: Oh, that's not right.

01:56:31
<transcript>: We're getting there, people. Andrew Bird's not gonna get this there, though.

01:56:31
<transcript>: not with that

01:56:32
<transcript>: Not with that music.

01:56:37
<transcript>: Have to enable to false.

01:56:37
<transcript>: oh i

01:56:44
yaqoobarm: KappaWealth

01:56:46
<transcript>: Oh, I still have it enabled to false. Where do I have that? Oh, yeah. In the rewards. That JSON, right. Oh, maybe it won't override that.

01:56:50
<transcript>: Maybe that's the problem.

01:56:54
<transcript>: Let's try that.

01:57:00
<transcript>: I expect it to update it now, see? I expect it to update it.

01:57:02
<transcript>: Just still update it when I hit that button.

01:57:02
<transcript>: there's

01:57:09
<transcript>: There's. It was just that was not working, but I think it was. The ID was mismatched. Okay, so it should be disabled. I hit the button.

01:57:09
<transcript>: another

01:57:11
<transcript>: Another test.

01:57:13
adamdotdev: JUST A TEST

01:57:20
stephensaggyball: Man how many keyboard are u giving away

01:57:23
<transcript>: Just say test. Now I'm gonna have to qualify so much when it's a real one, I'm gonna have to be like, this is the real thing. You can actually ever need it. I'm happy it so much because I've tested it so much.

01:57:28
iamreda: @StephenSaggyBall 1

01:57:29
<transcript>: That's funny, Stephen. I'm giving away one keyboard. You're not listening. So you're not seeing.

01:57:33
<transcript>: It still didn't do it though.

01:57:40
<transcript>: No errors this time. Just didn't do it.

01:57:42

nexxeln: @blizztera yes

01:57:55
<transcript>: Enable.

01:57:55
<transcript>: reward

01:57:56
<transcript>: Reward.

01:58:03
<transcript>: Is pause, false.

01:58:11
<transcript>: Okay. Whatever. That's not working. I can't unpause it. I know it works. Because when I go on break, I pause all my all my things.

01:58:13
iamreda: @datSycko that's like 200 keyboards

01:58:18
<transcript>: So I know I can unpause through the API. I just don't know why it's not working.

01:58:19
stewartjarod: Ooh, speaking of keyboards... I convinced my wife to use her productivity funds to build a fancy silent mechanical keyboard.

01:58:20
<transcript>: Don't know.

yeltrah_: @blizztera I don't see why not...in the long run it will increase productivity but the starting point will be a struggle so you have tok eep at it

01:59:55
stephensaggyball: every1 knows u only test in prod

01:59:57
<transcript>: i don't see

01:59:57
<transcript>: Wait a minute.

01:59:59
<transcript>: I don't see it at all. It didn't do it.

02:00:02
<transcript>: Are we not even running that code.

02:00:06
<transcript>: Oh, we have an error before that.

02:00:06
<transcript>: i

02:00:09
<transcript>: I feel really dumb, but that's probably what's happening.

02:00:11
stewartjarod: @blizztera would be another thing on top of everything else to learn... can get frustrating

02:00:13
<transcript>: Oh, man.

02:00:17
<transcript>: Wrapping an error before we get to enable.

02:00:18
blizztera: I think the funniest thing when I first started coding 2 years ago I didn't know what an ide was so I just coded in python using the terminal for the first 7 months

02:00:19
<transcript>: Reward.

02:00:23
<transcript>: So this is erroring or something.

02:00:26
<transcript>: One of these is erroring.

02:00:28
<transcript>: Let's go to.

02:00:30
<transcript>: Give away.

02:00:34
<transcript>: Okay. So that's right.

02:00:38
yeltrah_: Remember when we used to code in Sublime Text

02:00:43
<transcript>: Copy file sync, write file sync.

02:00:50
<transcript>: Is it actually pacing files into here? Yeah.

02:00:54
uberrick: Yeah learning vim could be another barrier to learning how to code so would treat it as a separate thing. Almost like learning to touch type haha

02:00:54
rickrickyy: @StephenSaggyBall why test when you have users ?

02:00:56
stewartjarod: I started in Notepad and found notepad++ and thought i was in heaven

02:01:00
<transcript>: Interesting.

02:01:00
<transcript>: anybody see it

02:01:02
<transcript>: Anybody see it? What's the problem here.

02:01:02
yeltrah_: then Atom, then Vscode, now Vim...well that was my journey anyway

02:01:06
<transcript>: What's the problem.

02:01:13
<transcript>: 10 hours later no yens we don't have 10 hours.

02:01:18
<transcript>: We will get this done.

02:01:18
<transcript>: i'd

02:01:21
<transcript>: I'd say in the next ten minutes we have to.

02:01:23
uberrick: @stewartjarod notepad++ is heaven. The first one I used too haha

02:01:24
<transcript>: Chip wheel. Thank you for the follow.

02:01:24

02:22:03
lilfreezi: how long did it take for the MVP of statmuse?

02:22:27
stewartjarod: woah

02:22:33
yeltrah_: Looks great Adam

02:22:33
<transcript>: I gotta figure out what my overlays are broken. I guess all of the notifications from Twitch could have broken something that was a lot of notifications.

02:22:33
<transcript>: i'm

02:22:36
<transcript>: maybe we'll build

02:22:36
<transcript>: I'm just gonna assume that's what it was.

02:22:39
<transcript>: Maybe we'll build something a little better next time to handle giveaways.

02:22:43
uberrick: nothing a restart won't fix haha

02:22:46
dev_is_fun: @DeadRobotDev I though I was sending an emoji but y misclicked, lol

02:22:47
<transcript>: How long did it take for the MVP of Statmeues? So I think three months, a little freezie. We built Statmes over three months.

02:22:52
absenth762: Maybe the Overlays should have been written in Python instead of NextJS. ;)

02:22:54
absenth762: I kid.

02:22:55
<transcript>: The the initial like we built a demo video for a beta. It was private bait. After three months.

02:22:55
<transcript>: and we

02:23:00
<transcript>: And we put a video of it on Twitter, and it kind of blew up on, like, MBA, Twitter.

02:23:00
danielgerep: standup time now, got to go =)

02:23:05
danielgerep: Thank you Adam!

02:23:08
<transcript>: And yeah, we need to refund. I just occurred me. We need to refund late in 50 points. How do we do that? How can I refund.

02:23:10
laytanl_: When is your first yt vid coming?

02:23:13
<transcript>: His 5000 points.

02:23:19
fragaverage: cant refund them because they auto confirm

02:23:20
laytanl_: Don't worry about it

02:23:25
jenswoeste: thats a new flavour of "webex caused the crash" -> "twitch notification caused the crash"

02:23:29
<transcript>: We'll figure it out later. I hope you 50 points. When's my first YouTube video coming, it was gonna come this week. I don't know. With my sickness. So it's my kids being sick. It's possible that doesn't happen. Yeah, that auto confirm. Okay, later. I owe you 5000 points. Somehow I'll make that up to you in some way.

02:23:34
<transcript>: Newfoot Webex cosmetrate.

02:23:34
<transcript>: yeah

02:23:41
stewartjarod: drink plenty of fluids ;d

02:23:46
<transcript>: but

02:23:46
<transcript>: Yeah. So three months, we put out a video on the Internet, and then things kind of took off from there. That was the statme's Genesis. I've got news regarding statmes coming soon, too. I don't want to talk about it too soon.

02:23:49
cowfacedude99: you can refund points I think

02:23:49
<transcript>: But I've got news.

02:23:59
<transcript>: Yeah, Cathies, you can refund them. But I think only if you can only refund them.

02:24:04
hambonemcglone: StatMuseNews

02:24:05
laytanl_: Don't worry about the points

02:24:07
lilfreezi: ive seen statmuse on my twitter timeline for so long, awesome to hear that you were a part of creating it

02:24:08
<transcript>: If it wasn't auto accepted, we ought to accept them. So I think that's a problem. Okay, I'm gonna hop off here so I can kind of coordinate with sigmofo.
