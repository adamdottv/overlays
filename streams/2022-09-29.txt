00:12:20
aminunes: Yes i got, i already said thanks to the guy o gived

00:12:23
<transcript>: This background. You see, it's not real.

00:12:23
<transcript>: should i

00:12:25
<transcript>: Should I tell you that.

00:12:25
<transcript>: shiv

00:12:35
sargath666: It's pretty normal when males are having 37C during some cold, we're dying every-time xD

00:12:37
<transcript>: Shivan, I tell you that. I'm just. It's actually all green screen. Now it's so that I can do stuff like this. Like I can pull up stuff behind me. Oh, that's that's kind of creepy, actually. Oh, it's gonna be infinite. Look at this.

00:12:46
<transcript>: Pretty normal and males are having 37 degrees Celsius during some cold we're dying every time.

00:12:52
<transcript>: Wait. 37 Degrees Celsius. What is that? Is that a fever.

00:12:52
<transcript>: that hotter

00:12:55
<transcript>: That hotter than 98 six.

00:12:57
<transcript>: Hot hotter than humans should be.

00:13:02
<transcript>: I only know Fahrenheit. I should do the math. I don't know the math.

00:13:07
<transcript>: We're gonna play with the camera today.

00:13:07
<transcript>: we're gonna play

00:13:11
<transcript>: We're gonna play with. Well, it's the camera that's normally it's like my keyboard. Camera.

00:13:11
<transcript>: we're gonna put

00:13:13
<transcript>: We're gonna put it.

00:13:13
<transcript>: it's on a

00:13:17
aminunes: 98.6F

00:13:18
<transcript>: It's on a mechanical Dib and rotating unit.

00:13:18
<transcript>: all of these

00:13:22
<transcript>: All of these mechanical 98 gotcha.

00:13:22
<transcript>: i got

00:13:24
<transcript>: I gotcha.

00:13:25
theruggedbear: more camera game ?

00:13:38
<transcript>: I'm a terrible patient. I really am my wife is she can be sick and still do everything like she didn't skip a beat. And I'm kind of like the slightest bit of sickness, and I'm out.

00:13:38
<transcript>: yeah

00:13:51
<transcript>: Yeah. More camera stuff. So I've got a camera. It's on a mechanical jib. And you can control it with an SDK. So that's sounds extremely fun. Like we can. I can move the thing around.

00:13:51
<transcript>: in my

00:13:56
<transcript>: In my Twitch app. My Twitch overlays like we could have it do things.

00:13:56
<transcript>: i don't know

00:14:03
<transcript>: I don't know what I think it'll just be like when I go to break, I'll just have it kind of like panning and doing something weird in the office.

00:14:08
<transcript>: Instead of just staring at the keyboard and a fixed position that's my current thought.

00:14:08
<transcript>: but we

00:14:11
<transcript>: But we could do a lot of things with it. Who knows.

00:14:13
cristhianjhlcom: Hello adam, how you doing?

00:14:15
<transcript>: Yeah, I'm gonna Actually, I'm just gonna add it to this scene.

00:14:15
<transcript>: watch this

00:14:16
<transcript>: Watch this.

00:14:16
<transcript>: just because

00:14:18
<transcript>: Just because I can.

00:14:20
<transcript>: Let's add.

00:14:20
<transcript>: a new

00:14:21
<transcript>: A new.

00:14:23
<transcript>: What do I want to add.

00:14:23
<transcript>: i guess i can just add

00:14:28
<transcript>: I guess I can just add the scene. Got the office keyboard scene. Here we go.

00:14:33
<transcript>: Okay, it's too big.

00:14:35
<transcript>: Clearly it's taking up the entire.

00:14:35
<transcript>: all right

00:14:37
<transcript>: All right.

00:14:39
<transcript>: How about this.

00:14:42
<transcript>: We can put it in the scene.

00:14:42
<transcript>: behind me

00:14:45
<transcript>: Behind me now I'm just doing stuff because I can really.

00:14:45
<transcript>: fill it

00:14:47
<transcript>: Fill it.

00:14:49
<transcript>: Too far? That was too far.

00:14:52
<transcript>: Hundreds of layering it.

00:14:52
<transcript>: there

00:14:54
<transcript>: There.

00:14:54
<transcript>: yeah

00:14:55
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:14:55
<transcript>: now it's behind

00:15:04
<transcript>: Now it's behind my head. Right. So this is the camera and we can move it around. Let's see if I can do it really quick. I just was playing with it before I started the stream.

00:15:04
<transcript>: so i've

00:15:08
<transcript>: So I've got like a little this thing until we get the SDK going.

00:15:08
<transcript>: hi there

00:15:12
<transcript>: Hi, there. Kristen. I'm doing Well, how are you doing.

00:15:14
sikmofo: morning sir

00:15:16
<transcript>: So if we move it to pose one.

00:15:16
jackysono: Morning Adam, are we getting hand cam?

00:15:22
<transcript>: I don't know oh connection loss select key to reset.

00:15:29
<transcript>: And Jackie Sono, we are getting something. It's a keyboard Cam.

00:15:29
<transcript>: but

00:15:32
<transcript>: But we're gonna move it around.

00:15:32
<transcript>: join

00:15:38
<transcript>: Join a paired group? I don't know. Do I want to join a paired group? Let's just share my screen. Let's just go over here.

00:15:44
<transcript>: This is the web app that controls it. Let's see. Is it still connected.

00:15:44
<transcript>: guess

00:15:46
andom: Got a salary raise yesterday whoop whoop

00:15:49
<transcript>: Guess gonna work still let's see join a paired group.

00:15:50
<transcript>: Okay.

00:15:54
<transcript>: Connecting.

00:15:54
<transcript>: cool

00:15:55

00:15:55
<transcript>: maybe

00:15:57
<transcript>: Maybe maybe cool.

00:16:05
caldotjs: hello adam :) how are you doing?

00:16:05
<transcript>: Connection problem.

00:16:07
jackysono: @Andom whoop whoop!

00:16:08
<transcript>: Let's just start over.

00:16:08
<transcript>: let's just

00:16:10
<transcript>: Let's just let's start out.

00:16:11
delvoid: Heyooo

00:16:13
<transcript>: Hey, Kyle, that I'm doing well.

<transcript>: Congratulations on your Rays. That's super cool.

00:16:27
caldotjs: what are we doing today?

00:16:28
<transcript>: Okay. So I need to connect to this thing.

00:16:31
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:16:31
<transcript>: pair and connect

00:16:31
tayloreddev: afternoon, this looks new

00:16:35
<transcript>: Pair. And connect. Paired groups. Authority. Paired. Okay, connect to it.

00:16:35
<transcript>: oh

00:16:39
yeltrah_: @Andom Great job man, well deserved

00:16:39
<transcript>: Oh, okay, let's recreate. Let's start over.

00:16:43
<transcript>: Switch set up.

00:16:46
<transcript>: Let's.

00:16:49
<transcript>: Pare, and connect.

00:16:55
<transcript>: I'm gonna have to turn them off one SEC.

00:16:55
i_processor: Hey Adam. An off-topic question, Do you recommend using a complete all-in-one headset or just a headphone + external microphone ? ;)

00:17:21
<transcript>: Alright.

00:17:24
<transcript>: Eye Processor welcome to Chat first time chat.

00:17:34
<transcript>: Off topic do you recommend using a complete Allinone headset or just a headphone plus external microphone? I like external microphones. I think.

00:17:34
<transcript>: there probably are

00:17:35
<transcript>: There probably are.

00:17:38
<transcript>: Combine units that are pretty good, but.

00:17:40
<transcript>: I generally prefer.

00:17:41
cowfacedude99: !today

00:17:41
fossabot: Building awguess with the t3 stack (!awguess)

00:17:51
<transcript>: Separate. I think you get better quality with both of them, but that's it. I'm not tested any of I think they're could be great combined ones these days. I just it's been a long time since I've used one.

00:17:53
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:17:53
<transcript>: pair

00:17:55
<transcript>: Pair and connect.

00:17:58
<transcript>: But.

00:18:00
<transcript>: Okay.

00:18:04
<transcript>: I'm gonna connect all those.

00:18:05
caldotjs: handed in my 50 page thesis on monday! preparing my presentation and then I am a free man :D

00:18:07
<transcript>: Alright.

00:18:07
<transcript>: we've created

00:18:10
<transcript>: We've created a group. I'm gonna connect to it.

00:18:10
<transcript>: and

00:18:13
<transcript>: And now I think we should be able to move it around.

00:18:16
<transcript>: Yeah, yeah? So I gotta create some poses.

00:18:20
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:18:20
<transcript>: how come

00:18:27
<transcript>: How come I do this in a way that you guys can see it? I need to let's just add it to this scene, too. Let's add.

00:18:29
<transcript>: Add scene.

00:18:31
<transcript>: Office.

00:18:31
<transcript>: keyboard

00:18:32
<transcript>: Keyboard.

00:18:34
<transcript>: Okay.

00:18:37
<transcript>: We'll scale it down.

00:18:37
<transcript>: i'll just put

00:18:40
<transcript>: I'll just put it up here in the corner somewhere.

00:18:40
<transcript>: and

00:18:42
<transcript>: And then this.

00:18:42
<transcript>: scene

00:18:43
<transcript>: Scene.

00:19:00
<transcript>: We need to put. Okay, so let's see that's the camera. So I'm gonna move it around and we're gonna create poses. I think that's the idea. Here. We save poses. We'll just call the current pose pose once. Okay.

00:19:08
<transcript>: Yeah. What do we think.

00:19:19
<transcript>: We'll try that pose.

00:19:24
<transcript>: Okay. So now we should be able to from the SDK.

00:19:28
<transcript>: Theoretically we should be able to.

00:19:28
<transcript>: like call

00:19:31
<transcript>: Like call those two poses and make the camera move around.

00:19:31
<transcript>: let's just

00:19:33
<transcript>: Let's just test that it actually.

00:19:33
<transcript>: moves

00:19:34
<transcript>: Moves.

00:19:37
<transcript>: Is it moving.

00:19:45
<transcript>: Very slowly, so we need to speed it up.

00:19:48
<transcript>: Do you see the moving see it.

00:19:52
<transcript>: Removing let's just go over to the scene.

00:19:52
<transcript>: ooh

00:19:54
<transcript>: Ooh cinematic.

00:19:58
<transcript>: Now if only there was something interesting going on in this room.

00:19:59
theruggedbear: this looks dooope !

00:20:01
<transcript>: To justify all the cinema.

00:20:03
andom: OOh this is cool

00:20:03
<transcript>: Yeah, it looks pretty cool, isn't it.

00:20:03
<transcript>: like

00:20:07
sikmofo: this production value

00:20:07
<transcript>: Like it's moving. It's not nice and smooth too.

00:20:09
sikmofo: how about that

00:20:11
jackysono: Bro thats awesome lol

00:20:14
<transcript>: So how do we introduce this into the stream in a way that's worth doing.

00:20:16
<transcript>: That's the question.

00:20:17
yeltrah_: Wow

00:20:18
<transcript>: How do we.

00:20:18
<transcript>: how do

00:20:18
delvoid: zoom zoom zoom

00:20:24
oetziofficial: yooo that looks dope!

00:20:25
sargath666: Is it loud?

00:20:25
<transcript>: How do we how do we want to do this? I think just during the break, like, every time I take a break, so like every time I pee.

00:20:25
<transcript>: there's gonna be some

00:20:26
andom: how fast can it be

00:20:30
laytanl_: Hello!

00:20:45
<transcript>: There's gonna be some production value involved. I'll say, like, oh, got a pee because I drink all this stuff, and then I'll leave and the camera will be like, panning and like, watching the office or something, and then go to the keyboard or something. I don't know. We think the cool thing is, it's just an SDK, just a web app that I can, like, a web endpoint. I can hit locally on my local network.

00:20:45
<transcript>: and

00:20:50
jackysono: following you as you leave the room

00:20:53
<transcript>: And I can change poses so we can set as many poses as we want. Well, I say that I think we can set six poses.

00:20:53
<transcript>: it can be

00:20:53
tayloreddev: chat controls the movement then chaos insues LUL

00:21:06
<transcript>: It can be in all these different poses. I can have it animate just between them just bounce around continuously. They could just pop in every once in a while. I don't know. There's a lot of stuff we can do with it. I still haven't. Really. I don't know. I've been sick. These ideas have been like, as I've been laying in bed.

00:21:08
<transcript>: Okay.

00:21:08
<transcript>: let's see

00:21:11
<transcript>: Let's see. What do we think? You may have great ideas.

00:21:19
<transcript>: Oh, shoot, cafe today we are not building. Aw, guess I should update that. I just. I don't know how to do that quickly.

00:21:19
<transcript>: false a bot like

00:21:24
<transcript>: False a bot. Like I always come in here and there's. I know there's a way to do it, like from the chat.

00:21:26
<transcript>: Let's see today.

00:21:53
<transcript>: It's. Edelcrom.

00:21:53

<transcript>: Woke how that you hand it in your 50 page thesis? Ooh.

00:22:03
<transcript>: is this for

00:22:04
<transcript>: Is this for.

00:22:10
<transcript>: For like a Masters or a PhD or. I don't know. They called that everywhere else.

00:22:10
<transcript>: that's what we call

00:22:12
<transcript>: That's what we call them in the us.

00:22:30
<transcript>: Chat controlled Nerf gun. Now we're just getting into.

00:22:30
<transcript>: some crazy

00:22:32
<transcript>: Some crazy ideas.

00:22:39
<transcript>: Check if it has Edit. Comm inside chat. Oh, Edit command.

00:22:39
andom: how fast can the camera move?

00:22:42
<transcript>: That be in here, like built in or something.

00:22:45
<transcript>: Edit.com.

00:22:45
<transcript>: edit

00:22:47
<transcript>: Edit CMD. There we go.

00:22:47
<transcript>: enable

00:22:50
<transcript>: Enable. So now I should be able to edit.

00:22:50
<transcript>: let's just

00:22:59
<transcript>: Let's just try this. I need to be able to do this. Bachelor's thesis gotcha very cool, Calvar. How fast can the camera move? Let's just find out.

00:22:59
<transcript>: let's just see

00:23:14
<transcript>: Let's just see how fast it can move. Can you add remove via this SDK poses? You can. Yeah. You can actually change the poses. The problem is like, Well, I guess. Yeah, we could control we could actually move the camera around with the SDK and then save a pose. Yeah.

00:23:14
<transcript>: i mean we could do

00:23:16
<transcript>: I mean we could do anything we want.

00:23:16
<transcript>: i think it

00:23:18
<transcript>: I think it's pretty.

00:23:18
<transcript>: pretty open

00:23:21
<transcript>: Pretty open ended. So how do I edit it? Command. Let's just try this edit.

00:23:21
<transcript>: command

00:23:25
<transcript>: Command and I guess I just do like the name. And then what I want it to say.

00:23:25
<transcript>: so like today

00:23:26

cowfacedude99: you might want to play with the permissions

00:23:56
<transcript>: Cool. Cool. So that works. Now know how to do the edit command. That that's gonna save some time. Okay, let's see how fast we can move this camera. That sounds fun.

00:23:56
<transcript>: here we

00:23:58
yeltrah_: !dadjoke

00:23:59
fossabot: @yeltrah_ What do I look like? A JOKE MACHINE!?

00:24:02
<transcript>: Here we go. So speed hundred percent here's the fastest.

00:24:02
<transcript>: fastest

00:24:04
<transcript>: Fastest we can move it.

00:24:09
<transcript>: What's doing? Is it going to the.

00:24:15
<transcript>: Pose. It was on. I guess.

00:24:17
theruggedbear: pose 1 is the keyboard

00:24:17
<transcript>: I guess I was supposed.

00:24:21
<transcript>: One or two.

00:24:27
<transcript>: It's making a noise.

00:24:31
<transcript>: This is doing nothing though.

00:24:31
<transcript>: let's try

00:24:33
<transcript>: Let's try. Post two.

00:24:37
<transcript>: Okay, it's set on the fastest.

00:24:41
<transcript>: So I guess this is the fastest.

00:24:46
<transcript>: I don't know. That's not all that fast, is it.

00:24:52
<transcript>: 's Pretty slow.

00:24:52
<transcript>: actually

00:24:53
<transcript>: Actually.

00:24:57
<transcript>: Well.

00:24:59
<transcript>: I mean it's.

00:24:59
oetziofficial: is it the ease function?

00:25:03
<transcript>: Let's see what's the slowest then I feel like.

00:25:06
<transcript>: That's the fastest.

00:25:11
yeltrah_: Man that room you are in is pretty dope...movie production

00:25:14
<transcript>: So go faster in this direction. I feel like it's weird that you're seeing my whole profile. I don't know. This is like a side of me that the internet hasn't seen kind of creeps me out.

00:25:17
<transcript>: Sick Mofo.

00:25:17

theruggedbear: dox ? Kappa

00:25:36
sikmofo: yeah of course, its fine

00:25:38
<transcript>: Yeah, that's a good call. Can anybody just edit a command? Is that what you're saying.

00:25:41
<transcript>: Oh, the ease function. Maybe it'll go faster if I turn.

00:25:41
<transcript>: easing off

00:25:43
<transcript>: Easing off.

00:25:45
yeltrah_: Iceland, nice !!

00:25:47

<transcript>: Guess I don't have to always come over here. I've got a button to do that.

00:26:43
<transcript>: Okay. So it's not very fast, but let's play with the ease in and out. So I turn E's in off.

00:26:43
<transcript>: so

00:26:46
sikmofo: UPS says monday sooo should be soon :D

00:26:53
<transcript>: So that's pose something that poses one was the camera. So it's always the keyboard. So it's on post two. No, it's on. I don't know.

00:26:58
<transcript>: Sorry on that. Positive.

00:27:06
<transcript>: There's a lot of, like, calibration and stuff you can do with these things. So I might need to play with it. Like that looked a little jerky.
